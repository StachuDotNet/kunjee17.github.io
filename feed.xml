&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a first thought this task can be done by any &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system"&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; and there is no need for anything else. But how can I explain my heart which can't tolerate PHP around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kunjan.in/images/nonotthisagain.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And frankly speaking there is no requirement of complete, heavy, slow, sluggish CMS. And if we were having that; we may be not doing any madness but still finding plug-ins on web. I personally like the freedom of simple HTML page. You can unleash the imagination on that but not on CMS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I thought why not &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;? and I also know &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX&lt;/a&gt; so that will be easy and fast. And really it was. And hosting on &lt;a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; is even more fun. There were some pain points but it was all OK at the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now it times to save the data. Azure do offer quite few options for that; but again this heart never listen to me. I choose NOSQL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the dinosaur, manage your own VM. And I was like &lt;a href="http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/"&gt;nooooooooooooooooooooo&lt;/a&gt;. I was knowing about &lt;a href="http://cloudant.com"&gt;Cloudant&lt;/a&gt; from long back. Even before IBM bought it. It is indeed a wonderful service and also kinda free for small stuff. I thought this will be best fit for now. As we are just starting, taking our first baby steps in the world of web. We are MAD but still we are kids. 
&lt;img src="http://kunjan.in/images/Babies.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is no need of scary relations ships with database. So, I decided to use this one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as one problem is solved other started. It is saving data that is in JSON format. That is untyped and F# is statically typed. I have tried few libraries developed in C# but was not happy. So, I thought it is just a HTTP request, why shouldn't I give it as shot to make one of my own helper module? It is may be some what dirty attempt but I got it working what I needed with less than 100 lines. Here is code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#r "../packages/Http.fs.1.4.0/lib/net40/HttpClient.dll"
#r "../packages/Newtonsoft.Json.6.0.6/lib/net45/Newtonsoft.Json.dll"

open HttpClient
open Newtonsoft.Json
open Newtonsoft.Json.Linq

[&amp;lt;CLIMutableAttribute&amp;gt;]
type Row&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt; = 
    { id : string
      key : string
      value : 'a }

[&amp;lt;CLIMutableAttribute&amp;gt;]
type ResultSet&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt; = 
    { total_rows : int
      offset : int
      rows : Row&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt; [] }

[&amp;lt;CLIMutableAttribute&amp;gt;]
type PostResult = 
    { ok : string
      id : string
      rev : string }

[&amp;lt;CLIMutableAttribute&amp;gt;]
type PostError = 
    { error : string
      reason : string }

let cloudantUrl = @"&amp;lt;cloudanturl/databasename/&amp;gt;"
let username = @"&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;"
let password = @"&amp;lt;password&amp;gt;"

let private cloudantGet url = 
    let request = 
        createRequest Get url
        |&amp;gt; withBasicAuthentication username password
        |&amp;gt; withHeader (ContentType "application/json")
    request |&amp;gt; getResponseBody

let private cloudantPost url data = 
    let request = 
        createRequest Post url
        |&amp;gt; withBasicAuthentication username password
        |&amp;gt; withBody data
        |&amp;gt; withHeader (ContentType "application/json")
    request |&amp;gt; getResponseBody

let private checkDataForNewId (data : JObject) = 
    let removeIdrev (data : JObject) = 
        data.Remove("_id") |&amp;gt; ignore
        data.Remove("_rev") |&amp;gt; ignore
    if System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(data.["_id"].ToString()) || System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(data.["_rev"].ToString()) then 
        removeIdrev data
    data

let PostJson&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt; data = 
    let serializedObject = JObject.FromObject(data) |&amp;gt; checkDataForNewId
    serializedObject.Add("$doctype", JToken.Parse("'" + data.GetType().Name + "'"))
    cloudantPost cloudantUrl &amp;lt;| serializedObject.ToString()

let GetJsonByType&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt; = 
    let resultset = 
        JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&amp;lt;ResultSet&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
            (cloudantGet (cloudantUrl + "/_design/Type/_view/" + typeof&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;.Name))
    query { 
        for row in resultset.rows do
            select row.value
    }

let GetJsonById&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt; Id = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(cloudantGet (cloudantUrl + Id))

[&amp;lt;CLIMutableAttribute&amp;gt;]
type Person = 
    { _id : string
      _rev : string
      FirstName : string
      LastName : string }

let newPerson = 
    { _id = ""
      _rev = ""
      FirstName = "Boom"
      LastName = "Baam" }

let inline isNull (x:^a when ^a : not struct) =
    obj.ReferenceEquals (x, Unchecked.defaultof&amp;lt;_&amp;gt;)

let findPerson = 
    query { 
        for p in GetJsonByType&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; do
            where (p.FirstName = "Boom")
            select p
            headOrDefault
            }
isNull findPerson    
GetJsonById&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; ("3b389dc6b8ee0dcbf7f366faaa59cf42")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In above code below part is just for testing. And even with that code snippet is 98 lines. So, with blank line removed it is even short. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in cloudant I need to create views so its code is like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function(doc) {
    if (doc.$doctype !== "Person") return;
    var copydoc = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(doc));
    delete copydoc["$doctype"];
    emit(doc._id,copydoc);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need &lt;code&gt;$doctype&lt;/code&gt; while I am inserting or updating data only, not while reading. So, I am removing it. As I am already filtering based on type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In above code two libraries are getting used one is &lt;a href="https://github.com/relentless/Http.fs"&gt;Http.fs&lt;/a&gt; and the other is &lt;a href="http://james.newtonking.com/json"&gt;JSON.net&lt;/a&gt; libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In library as you can see I am not doing anything special. I am inserting data with type information. If new data is there I am removing &lt;code&gt;_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_rev&lt;/code&gt; and for simplicity sake I had put &lt;code&gt;_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_rev&lt;/code&gt; in all the types I am using to interacting with Cloudant data store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now whenever I am reading I just need to give type and that will be fetched as collection of that typed records. And once collection came to memory now I have powerful F# to process data. In above code I am using &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; expression to do so. It becomes very easy and fun to use. And it is damn fast. At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't know it if perfect or not. It kinda part functional and part Object Oriented as far as I know. Should I convert this to Type Provider or is it possible or not? I don't know. But one thing is sure I am achieving what I wanted with simplest possible code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear F# community members&lt;/strong&gt; do provide your views on this. And also let me know if it will be use full to make it more mature and push it as nuget package. Or may be a type provider for Cloudant? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Highly inspired by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dmohl"&gt;Daniel Mohl's&lt;/a&gt; old library &lt;a href="https://github.com/dmohl/FSharpCouch"&gt;FSharpCouch&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you... :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when it comes to hosting I love the &lt;a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; for various reasons. It is specially awesome when it comes to web sites. You do some experiments and throw it towards azure and that is ready for world to check out.

My many experiments with &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/category/functional-web/"&gt;F# and Web&lt;/a&gt; are already there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was talking with a friend about SailsJS and discussion kinda stuck at deployment part. As it is having kinda manual process involved. It is never a issue to fire a few commands but even why I should waste few key strokes when that can be done by Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Always a fan of continues integration and continues delivery mechanism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched Google to find out if anyone has done this before. Results showing couple of examples; but all with spinning up VM on Azure and hosting a application. But I think that is to a overkill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;code&gt;sails new&lt;/code&gt; and put a web.config file in root folder and try to published it with web matrix. And web site crashed. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I still don't recall when things just run without crashing at first shot with me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see the streaming log (&lt;em&gt;console.log in nodejs case&lt;/em&gt;) with &lt;code&gt;azure site log tail &amp;lt;sitename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and found out that it is not getting node modules. That is weird as I was pushing npm_modules too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I tried with github repository. And that thing just worked. Without any issue and also directly in production mode. (&lt;em&gt;I seriously don't know how it switched to production mode. As for production mode I need to pass parameter --prod with app.js&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: Don't forget to change server.js to app.js in web.config. I guess it is kinda required. I am also skipping npm_modules with gitignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now first page is running without any issue. So, now it is time to sailing on azure web sites with sailsjs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="http://sailslift.azurewebsites.net/"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunjee17/sailslift"&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to clone and give PR with some demo application. I seriously like to see how far it can go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if any further details are required.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this because recently I got chance to work with android using Java. And experience was not at all good. And reason is not so surprisingly Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am will not explain anything instead I just copy paste three code snippets. All are doing same thing but they are all in different languages. Now, for the people who think that language doesn't make any difference; this post is for them. Here I am not including any frameworks like Reactive UI or Xamarin.Forms. If I include them then this competition will be one sided. (Xamarin Sided)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code Snippet in Java&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    int count = 0;
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        setEvents();
    }

    private void setEvents() {
        final Button mybutton = (Button) this.findViewById(R.id.myButton);
        mybutton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                mybutton.setText(String.valueOf(count));
            }
        });

        final TextView seekbarView = (TextView) this.findViewById(R.id.seekbarTextView);
        SeekBar seekbar = (SeekBar) this.findViewById(R.id.seekBar1);
        seekbar.setOnSeekBarChangeListener(new OnSeekBarChangeListener() {
            int progresssed = 0;
            @Override
            public void onStopTrackingTouch(SeekBar seekBar) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                seekbarView.setText(String.valueOf(progresssed));
            }

            @Override
            public void onStartTrackingTouch(SeekBar seekBar) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub

            }

            @Override
            public void onProgressChanged(SeekBar seekBar, int progress,
                    boolean fromUser) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                progresssed = progress;
            }
        });

        CheckBox checkbox = (CheckBox) this.findViewById(R.id.checkBox1);
        checkbox.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new OnCheckedChangeListener() {

            @Override
            public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton buttonView, boolean isChecked) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                Log.i("info","Checkbox is " + String.valueOf(isChecked));
            }
        });
    }



}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code Snippet in C#&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Activity (Label = "XamarinBlog", MainLauncher = true, Icon = "@drawable/icon")]
    public class MainActivity : Activity
    {
        int count = 1;

        protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
        {
            base.OnCreate (bundle);

            // Set our view from the "main" layout resource
            SetContentView (Resource.Layout.Main);
            var button = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;Button&amp;gt; (Resource.Id.myButton);
            button.Click += (sender, e) =&amp;gt; {
                button.Text = String.Format("{0} clicks",count);
                count++;
            };

            var seekbarTextView = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;TextView&amp;gt; (Resource.Id.seekbarTextView);
            var seekbar = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;SeekBar&amp;gt; (Resource.Id.seekBar1);
            seekbar.ProgressChanged += (sender, e) =&amp;gt; {
                seekbarTextView.Text = String.Format("The value of seekbar is {0}", e.Progress);
            };

            var checkbox = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;CheckBox&amp;gt; (Resource.Id.checkBox1);

            checkbox.CheckedChange += (sender, e) =&amp;gt; {
                Console.WriteLine("Checked changed!");
            };
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code Snippet in F#&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;lt;Activity(Label = "XamarinBlog", MainLauncher = true)&amp;gt;]
type MainActivity() = 
    inherit Activity()
    let mutable count : int = 1
    override this.OnCreate(bundle) = 
        base.OnCreate(bundle)
        // Set our view from the "main" layout resource
        this.SetContentView(Resource_Layout.Main)
        // Get our button from the layout resource, and attach an event to it
        let button = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;(Resource_Id.myButton)
        button.Click.Add(fun args -&amp;gt; 
            button.Text &amp;lt;- sprintf "%d clicks!" count
            count &amp;lt;- count + 1)
        let seekbarTextView = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;TextView&amp;gt;(Resource_Id.seekbarTextView)
        let seekbar = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;SeekBar&amp;gt;(Resource_Id.seekBar1)
        seekbar.ProgressChanged.Add
            (fun args -&amp;gt; seekbarTextView.Text &amp;lt;- sprintf "The value of seekbar is %A" args.Progress)

        let checkbox = this.FindViewById&amp;lt;CheckBox&amp;gt;(Resource_Id.checkBox1)
        checkbox.CheckedChange.Add(fun args -&amp;gt; printfn "Check changed")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you can see what I am trying to say here. I can become a good typist by writing code in Java but defiantly not good programmer. I don't know from which planet Java has incorporated it's Object Oriented model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xamarin is solving many problems by supporting C# and F# for android development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3 Xamarin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also compare code between C# and F# but don't tell anyone as right now I am bashing Java in this post. :P&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did make templates for &lt;a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; and I will continue to support that. But when it comes to real projects they go far beyond templates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently experimenting on something and obviously I am gonna use templates created by me. I created project and ran it. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt; it ran without any issue. And then I fire nuget update. &lt;strong&gt;Bang!!!&lt;/strong&gt; Nuget update reverted with the error of &lt;code&gt;object reference not found&lt;/code&gt;. I tried to find solution but failed. Then I tried same thing with &lt;a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5bd40817-0986-444d-a77d-482e43a48da7"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; official templates. It worked once and then failed again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought there is a issue with nuget or updated &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/archive/2014/08/20/announcing-the-release-of-visual-f-tools-3-1-2.aspx"&gt;tool chain of F#&lt;/a&gt;. God only knows. So, I checked other ways of updating packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew about &lt;a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/"&gt;paket&lt;/a&gt;. Either due to some bug or feature it just worked for start. Then I added &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/"&gt;emberjs&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/EmberJS/"&gt;nuget package&lt;/a&gt;. And got folder render error. Which is very &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; to F# projects. I know how to solve it. I normally always keep F# project file open in different text editor for this kinda issues. So, I move few include line here and there to keep same folder in order and solve the issue. Then I added few more JS libs and paket install gives same issue again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kunjan.in/images/double_facepalm.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all these issues were not enough that azure deployment is not completed without a little hack I have mentioned in my previous &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/2014/03/signalr-nancy-azure-with-fsharp/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. For the face last update should solved this issue but it is not working. May be feature is not completed or may be it is just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And above complete exercise took more than 7 hours and I deleted and added project more than 5 times just to make it work. Just to make the damn &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; work. That is it. Nothing more and nothing less. I was exactly feeling like &lt;img src="http://kunjan.in/images/rockypunched.jpeg" alt="" /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I changed project structure again and put a C# project as front and F# as library project. Just to make nuget happy. And also the Azure happy. As I don't want to mess around project files and want to write some code. I guess that is more important then hacking around tool chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know F# is far ahead of its time. It is a next gen language. But it is also a old enough language to have proper visual studio support. It should be supported and loved as any other language on .Net framework. At least from the tool chain point of view. I can always have work around but writing code in pure project in single language is always a fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please let me if I missed anything. Or making mistake on my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are improving fast and hopefully it will be at the same level where all language can find common ground. Hoping and waiting for &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/vnext"&gt;VNext&lt;/a&gt; support now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;- As per today I am neither married nor committed. And for that case never married and never committed. :P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever is following my progress must be knowing my love for F#. Neither me nor F# knows exact time and date when that happen. But now it is like if few days I have to pass without writing few lines to(in) F# then it felt like I have left software engineering for good. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;- As per today I am neither married nor committed. And for that case never married and never committed. :P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever is following my progress must be knowing my love for F#. Neither me nor F# knows exact time and date when that happen. But now it is like if few days I have to pass without writing few lines to(in) F# then it felt like I have left software engineering for good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am full time married to C#. My heart and soul still bleed for it. Still I am following &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonskeet"&gt;Jon Skeet&lt;/a&gt;. Still I am updating my self. But truly speaking; that enigma, that love, that emotions are lost. And final blow comes when I don't have to see C# on daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My profile changed at my day job. Can't share all the details though but it is not C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our shared time is getting less day by day. And even that less time getting consumed by newly found adventures with F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember a day when I visited it on &lt;a href="http://tryfsharp.org/"&gt;TryFsharp&lt;/a&gt;. And my first impression was 'OK'. But then slowly it started getting into me. Then more meeting happens at &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/"&gt;fsharp.org&lt;/a&gt;. Can't say anyone but just for F# I gave request to become a &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/foundation.html#founding_members"&gt;member of fsharp.org&lt;/a&gt; and luckily got accepted. Meetings became more often, is it love? I didn't know at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then something happen. I started burning midnight oil for F# and one day god answers my desire less efforts and first time I run F# code on &lt;a href="http://servicestackheroku.herokuapp.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.  I felt the first blink of love. And love got confirmation when my name got place at &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/guides/web/"&gt;fsharp.org&lt;/a&gt; with F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that there was no looking back, there were just milestones for a bonding that is getting stronger with every obstacle conquered. It includes my first community check in for &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f"&gt;visual studio template&lt;/a&gt;, my first experience of porting &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/2014/03/signalr-nancy-azure-with-fsharp/"&gt;Signalr and Nancy on azure&lt;/a&gt; and lately porting &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/2014/06/signalr-servicestack-azure-with-fsharp/"&gt;servicestack with SignalR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is never one sided. Whenever I have lots of data I have F#, whenever I have complicated (or not that complicated) algorithm I have F#. I want to do mobile I have F#, I want to make game &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; I have F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not that it is the only one but for me it is the one. So, simple, elegant, sweet, graceful and still so powerful. And never demanded anything, it just work on any platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all is good. I can't say so. I am still married to C#; my resume says so. I am still having same respect that I was having long back but may be that love is lost. I don't know whose fault it is; may be me may be F#. But things that stays is less fun and more friction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few things that only C# can do, few places like &lt;a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; only C# can go without any issues. It is not that I wanted to get separated but sometimes at some places it is not the best possible choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how far I can go with C# but my love for F# is reality. If I am continuing in software industry and if my choice will be granted, my first choice will F# as of now and may be for few more years to come.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NOTE: I still follow C# and quite good with it but if I get choice I will always go with F#. I just want that F# get same respect and love from business line of Microsoft Products. As things are changing in positive direction hopefully that day is not too far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no problem with making it work. But deployment on azure is a serious issue. And &lt;strong&gt;luckily&lt;/strong&gt; I completed that. Yes, there is a luck involved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read my previous &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/2014/03/signalr-nancy-azure-with-fsharp/"&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; for running Nancy and SignalR together. Then most of the things are same only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f"&gt;Servicestack template&lt;/a&gt; to create project. Remove global.asax &amp;amp; global.asax.fs (&lt;em&gt;yes remove it!&lt;/em&gt;). Install SignalR asp.net package from &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR/"&gt;nuget&lt;/a&gt;. And copy paste below code in AppCode.fs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace ServicestackSignalRFSharp.App_Start
    open ServiceStack
    open ServiceStack.Common
    open ServicestackSignalRFSharp
    open ServiceStack.Razor
    open System
    open Owin


    type AppHost() = 
        inherit AppHostBase("Hello F# Service", 
                                        typeof&amp;lt;HelloService&amp;gt;.Assembly)
        override this.Configure container =
            Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("In servicestack configure");
            this.Plugins.Add(new RazorFormat())
            ignore()


        static member start() = 
            let apphost = new AppHost()
            Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("In servicestack start");
            apphost.Init() |&amp;gt; ignore

    type Startup()=
        member x.Configuration(app : Owin.IAppBuilder) = 
            AppHost.start()
            Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("In signalr startup");
            app.MapSignalR() |&amp;gt; ignore        


    [&amp;lt;Microsoft.Owin.OwinStartup(typeof&amp;lt;Startup&amp;gt;)&amp;gt;]
    do ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't forget to rename the namespace as per your project namespace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per my Nancy article changed the index.cshtml to get signalR client running. Once done run it. It should work hello world of &lt;a href="http://servicestack.net"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; and Hello Chat from &lt;a href="http://signalr.net"&gt;SignalR&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If things still not work here is my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunjee17/ServicestackSignalRFSharp/"&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;. Have a look at code. And also it is deployed over &lt;a href="http://servicestacksignalrfsharp.azurewebsites.net/"&gt;azure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My Personal Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I like to clear it upfront. Even though I was able to run Servicestack and SignalR together but they are still running differently under the hood. Servicestack is hitting asp.net directly and signalR is hitting via &lt;a href="http://owin.org/"&gt;OWIN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also not making web service real time. It is just both can easily run together. Making them run together was easy task. But deploying on azure is a serious pain in a**. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, azure is. It is so damn easy to deploy traditional imperative C# project as azure web site but functional F# project. It is like giving death by a thousand cuts. You solve one issue and another issue came. Just like &lt;em&gt;pipeline&lt;/em&gt; operator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more like whatever F# is compensating by making development easy, deployment is making it even. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the same with above code. global.asax.fs is working in local, I can even put a break point but it is not working on azure. I put a trace in every possible function and at last find out. (Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot"&gt;Demis Bellot&lt;/a&gt; for pointing out this possible issue.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though F# is picking up new height, and I personally contributed and will continue to contribute in templates. But if someone want to take full advantage of F# in web development &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with cloud then s/he need to make one C# project and point F# to them. Just to get best of both worlds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, C# is still far better when it comes to csproj file. o_O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual working with functional language is always fun experience and now we have web service that we can scale with real time icing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Servicestack |&gt; Razor |&gt; SignalR |&gt; Azure (with little hiccups) |&gt; F# |&gt; lots of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xamarin is like technical democracy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A company of Technical People, by the technical people and for the technical people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kinda awesome. Just like their new studio. I am normally work on windows and have Visual Studio installed on my machine. Still many time I prefer to use Xamarin Studio. This new launch will force me more to do so more often. It is not crashing any more like older version while debugging. Even F# is now first class citizen of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am currently facing error while running android + F# project but I guess that will be some issue on my end only.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete new designer, Xamarin.Form api to provide abstraction for LOB applications and flow less studio. If this year will be known as mobile development revolution, Xamarin people will be considered as pioneer of that revolution. I will write more about Mobile application + F#. Now, I can't wait to dirty my hand with some android code and that is also in F#.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 Xamarin. You know I seriously do love you people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will try to cover as many person as possible who made important part in my life; mainly professionally and sometimes personally too. But if I miss someone, that will be completely unintentional and I am extremely sorry for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a little story. My life was nothing different then every other software engineer. I missed first class by .08% and get out of college in the era of recession. And technically know nothing but little bit of C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are pretty normal. Just like every other software person in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mu.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All dreams and no way to achieve it. Then luckily or unluckily I move to company where I need to work with &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc"&gt;Asp.Net MVC&lt;/a&gt;. First thing I did was find something on home site. I don't know there are still any archive available but at that time there is a video series by &lt;a href="http://www.wekeroad.com/"&gt;Rob Conery&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't even know him by then or even his reputation. For me he is Microsoft employee and I am working in Microsoft Technology so he is God sent. Whatever he say is truth nothing but the truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while wondering around his site, found the video he gave at &lt;a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/"&gt;NDC conference&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;The Next Big Thing Or Cool-Kid Koolaid? Slicing Through The Rhetoric of MVC vs Web Forms&lt;/strong&gt; . Sorry I didn't found any downloadable link for it but I still do have a copy of it. This video changed me up side down, changed my way of thinking and learning. I started questioning more and learning more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way &lt;strong&gt;Rob&lt;/strong&gt; is responsible for my way to community. Then I became customer/viewer/admirer of &lt;a href="http://tekpub.com/"&gt;tekpub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Yes, I do earn in rupees and spend in dollars&lt;/em&gt;. but every penny of it is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best thing happen is; it opens the door of open source projects. Its all started with leaving EF and checking out other ORMs. I'll not talk about them now, but will move to my few favourite web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is &lt;a href="http://servicestack.net/"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; and other is &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX&lt;/a&gt;. I do like others but this are kinda first ones' I fall in love with. And just like first love nothing can replace that. I like to thank them for their work. Both are wonderful frameworks to do the web development if someone is working in the .Net. One is for rapid web development and other is rapid web service development in true to the nature of Object Oriented Programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is one more transaction of me from Object Oriented Programming to Functional Programming. Trust me the F# community is awesome and that is kind of reason behind the transaction. Don't know why but they are simple awesome. And I love to thank them too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 1986 born, so I am kid to most of the member of the F# community. Most of them are coding even before the day I born. But whenever I stuck somewhere or something they help and give answer to any of my dumbest question. Thank You &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be not knowing philosophical programming without &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron"&gt;Jessica Kerr&lt;/a&gt;, will not be knowing Actors without &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rachelreese"&gt;Rachele Resse&lt;/a&gt;,functional programming will not be fun without &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bodil"&gt;Bodil&lt;/a&gt;'s presentation/talks, without infinite force of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dsyme"&gt;Don Syme&lt;/a&gt; there is no me &amp;lt;3 F# and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ptrelford"&gt;Phillip Trelford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/7sharp9"&gt;Dave Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin"&gt;Scott Wlaschin&lt;/a&gt; and others who are always there for community. I never meet any of them but they are always there whenever I need them. May be this is the reason Internet was invented, or if I say specifically then social network invented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry if I missed any other community members. But there is a long list. Hopefully someday I meet them and thank them in personally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even this blog is running on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philliphaydon"&gt;Phillip Haydon&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

Feeling is wonderful right? Now, add the your actress in the mixture. Have you said WOW??? How about director? Still heart is beating?!? How about having dinner with them? Nothing can be better than that.
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
I am having kinda same feeling. It is nothing new that &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; is dancing quite comfortable with &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to Daniel Mohl we are also having &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b55b8aac-b11a-4a6a-8a77-2153f46f4e2f"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; to get started with Nancy and F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I was doing some experiments around it. It was quite good. But how about running it on Owin. hmmm, it works flow less. Nothing more on code side other than few lines here and there. Then I found few projects running &lt;a href="http://signalr.net/"&gt;SignalR&lt;/a&gt; with F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knowing Nancy from a long time. But SignalR, I don't know anything about it. The only thing I know is that, it is super awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first task is to run Nancy on Owin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are simple steps. Using template create a asp.net host with razor project. remove asp.net host and add &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy.Owin/"&gt;Owin host&lt;/a&gt; using nuget package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to add startup file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Startup() = 
    member x.Configuration(app : Owin.IAppBuilder) =  app.UseNancy() |&amp;gt; ignore


[&amp;lt;Microsoft.Owin.OwinStartup(typeof&amp;lt;Startup&amp;gt;)&amp;gt;]
do ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And add simple Nancy code. The regular one. Nothing fancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is bootstrap class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Bootstrapper() =
    inherit DefaultNancyBootstrapper()
    override x.ApplicationStartup(container:TinyIoCContainer, pipelines:IPipelines) = 
        StaticConfiguration.DisableErrorTraces &amp;lt;- false
        base.ApplicationStartup(container,pipelines)
        ignore()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this is needed to trace the error if anything is there at nancy end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our index module &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type IndexModule() as x =
    inherit NancyModule()
    do x.Get.["/"] &amp;lt;- fun _ -&amp;gt; box x.View.["Index"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty lame right. But it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, add &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR/"&gt;Signalr asp.net host nuget package&lt;/a&gt; to project. As startup file is already there; no need to create one more. Just minor modification will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Startup() = 
    member x.Configuration(app : Owin.IAppBuilder) =  app.MapSignalR().UseNancy() |&amp;gt; ignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That MapSignalR thing is additionally added. I have just followed Hello World example of real time world. Create a chat application. So, here is the hub to broadcast the message to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type ChatHub() as this = 
    inherit Hub()
    member x.send (name : string, msg : string) = this.Clients.All?broadcastMessage (name, msg) |&amp;gt; ignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, copy paste code for html part. Here is code snippet. There is no need to go into detail as of now for JavaScript part.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is singnal R working great with Nancy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="text" id="message" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="button" id="sendmessage" value="Send" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="hidden" id="displayname" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ul id="discussion"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Script references. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Reference the jQuery library. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="Scripts/jquery-1.6.4.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Reference the SignalR library. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="Scripts/jquery.signalR-2.0.2.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Reference the autogenerated SignalR hub script. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="signalr/hubs"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Add script to update the page and send messages.--&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    $(function () {
        // Declare a proxy to reference the hub.
        var chat = $.connection.chatHub;
        // Create a function that the hub can call to broadcast messages.
        chat.client.broadcastMessage = function (name, msg) {
            // Html encode display name and message.

            var encodedName = $('&amp;lt;div /&amp;gt;').text(name).html();
            var encodedMsg = $('&amp;lt;div /&amp;gt;').text(msg).html();
            // Add the message to the page.
            $('#discussion').append('&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;' + encodedName
                + '&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;' + encodedMsg + '&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;');
        };
        // Get the user name and store it to prepend to messages.
        $('#displayname').val(prompt('Enter your name:', ''));
        // Set initial focus to message input box.
        $('#message').focus();
        // Start the connection.
        $.connection.hub.start().done(function () {
            $('#sendmessage').click(function () {
                // Call the Send method on the hub.
                chat.server.send($('#displayname').val(), $('#message').val());
                // Clear text box and reset focus for next comment.
                $('#message').val('').focus();
            });
        });
    });
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there is one "?" thing before broadcastMessage function. That is where dynamic method is getting called. F# do not support dynamic by default but there are many work around available. I personally prefer &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Dynamic/"&gt;Fsharp.dynamic&lt;/a&gt; library. It is better than other code snippets I found over other sites. But that is all personal choice how one like to handle dynamic functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is done. Hit F5 and you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is fun of working with Web if I can't publish it. But for now with F# web templates it is not possible. And that is known &lt;a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpCommunityTemplates/issues/28"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;. So, if I like to publish it on cloud like azure I need to give git hooks. That is easiest thing I can think off. But road is still not that smooth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment will break with some weird error. I followed &lt;a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/08/26/running-a-pure-f-web-api-on-azure-web-sites/"&gt;Mark's article&lt;/a&gt; to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needed to add below lines to .fsproj file after its own import tags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Import Project="$(VSToolsPath)\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" 
        Condition="'$(VSToolsPath)' != ''" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v11.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" 
        Condition="true" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And things are working like anything. No, issues at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nancy |&gt; Razor |&gt; SignalR |&gt; Azure |&gt; F# |&gt; lots of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please give it a shot. If it break somewhere let me know will try to solve it. Any suggestion to make things even better and streamlined are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Here is my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunjee17/NancySignalRFSharp"&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt; with updated code. Project created with web express 2013. Also it is deployed over &lt;a href="http://nancysignalrfsharp.azurewebsites.net/"&gt;azure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only mobile development but it is doing a hell of a lot of thing other than mobile development. Not only that it is surely having wonderful history with &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/"&gt;JavaScript framework development&lt;/a&gt;. I don't have anything to complain against that. 
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
But today I am going to talk about specifically one framework, that is &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/"&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt;. I was trying to something that can developed once and deployed everywhere. &lt;em&gt;Yes, it is kinda new trend in mobile development now a days.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do have working experience with &lt;a href="http://jquerymobile.com/"&gt;JQuery Moblie&lt;/a&gt;, but still I choose Sencha, due to its performance and preference for architecture. I did same mistake which &lt;a href="http://datachomp.com/"&gt;Rob Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; mentioned couple of days back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kunjee"&gt;@kunjee&lt;/a&gt; it’s always a balance of being able to push yourself but make sure you don’t go over a cliff from the push.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rob Sullivan (@DataChomp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DataChomp/statuses/447559429353787392"&gt;March 23, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I practically pushed my self over the cliff. I am particularly having nothing against &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/"&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt;. It is nothing but the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; awesome product. May be problem is on my side. I am not &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; doing mobile work. Mobile application is part of bigger idea or bigger application. So, there are many other things than running that very same thing on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Framework should help and if I can't get it up and running in hours it is coming into my way of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same thing happened with me. I have tried &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/"&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt;, other than having lots of boiler plate code; Sencha command tool is also broken. That is also few months back there is no way to generate store using command. I never understand why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of programming which is ruling the market as of now. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"&gt;Object Oriented Programming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;. In latter one you can compose functions and normally code tends to stay small while is first one code is more so there is complete tooling chain around that. One of that is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;. If that is broken, there is no way I can write that much code and that also in JavaScript. Dynamic typing language is good if I can use that nature, if I am writing code like static typing that is like worst of both world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is already functionally object oriented language. If I am doing only object oriented part of it I need my tools up and running perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also tried &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/architect/"&gt;Sencha Architect&lt;/a&gt;. It is good for starting but after using for sometime, it started coming into my way. And I was spending more time in learning tool than solving the real problem. I personally don't like this kinda tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be I am not smart enough to use &lt;a href="http://www.sencha.com"&gt;Sencha&lt;/a&gt; products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend quite a amount of time learning Sencha, and same amount of time I was able complete application using more simpler &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/phonejs.devexpress.com"&gt;Phonejs&lt;/a&gt;. It is little slow at start up but at least I am not slowing down my application to get out of development state. &lt;/p&gt;
