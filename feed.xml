Feeling is wonderful right? Now, add the your actress in the mixture. Have you said WOW??? How about director? Still heart is beating?!? How about having dinner with them? Nothing can be better than that.
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
I am having kinda same feeling. It is nothing new that &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; is dancing quite comfortable with &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to Daniel Mohl we are also having &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b55b8aac-b11a-4a6a-8a77-2153f46f4e2f"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; to get started with Nancy and F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I was doing some experiments around it. It was quite good. But how about running it on Owin. hmmm, it works flow less. Nothing more on code side other than few lines here and there. Then I found few projects running &lt;a href="http://signalr.net/"&gt;SignalR&lt;/a&gt; with F#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knowing Nancy from a long time. But SignalR, I don't know anything about it. The only thing I know is that, it is super awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first task is to run Nancy on Owin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are simple steps. Using template create a asp.net host with razor project. remove asp.net host and add &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy.Owin/"&gt;Owin host&lt;/a&gt; using nuget package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to add startup file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Startup() = 
    member x.Configuration(app : Owin.IAppBuilder) =  app.UseNancy() |&amp;gt; ignore


[&amp;lt;Microsoft.Owin.OwinStartup(typeof&amp;lt;Startup&amp;gt;)&amp;gt;]
do ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And add simple Nancy code. The regular one. Nothing fancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is bootstrap class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Bootstrapper() =
    inherit DefaultNancyBootstrapper()
    override x.ApplicationStartup(container:TinyIoCContainer, pipelines:IPipelines) = 
        StaticConfiguration.DisableErrorTraces &amp;lt;- false
        base.ApplicationStartup(container,pipelines)
        ignore()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this is needed to trace the error if anything is there at nancy end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our index module &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type IndexModule() as x =
    inherit NancyModule()
    do x.Get.["/"] &amp;lt;- fun _ -&amp;gt; box x.View.["Index"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty lame right. But it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, add &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR/"&gt;Signalr asp.net host nuget package&lt;/a&gt; to project. As startup file is already there; no need to create one more. Just minor modification will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Startup() = 
    member x.Configuration(app : Owin.IAppBuilder) =  app.MapSignalR().UseNancy() |&amp;gt; ignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That MapSignalR thing is additionally added. I have just followed Hello World example of real time world. Create a chat application. So, here is the hub to broadcast the message to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type ChatHub() as this = 
    inherit Hub()
    member x.send (name : string, msg : string) = this.Clients.All?broadcastMessage (name, msg) |&amp;gt; ignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, copy paste code for html part. Here is code snippet. There is no need to go into detail as of now for JavaScript part.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is singnal R working great with Nancy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="text" id="message" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="button" id="sendmessage" value="Send" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="hidden" id="displayname" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ul id="discussion"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Script references. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Reference the jQuery library. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="Scripts/jquery-1.6.4.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Reference the SignalR library. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="Scripts/jquery.signalR-2.0.2.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Reference the autogenerated SignalR hub script. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="signalr/hubs"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Add script to update the page and send messages.--&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    $(function () {
        // Declare a proxy to reference the hub.
        var chat = $.connection.chatHub;
        // Create a function that the hub can call to broadcast messages.
        chat.client.broadcastMessage = function (name, msg) {
            // Html encode display name and message.

            var encodedName = $('&amp;lt;div /&amp;gt;').text(name).html();
            var encodedMsg = $('&amp;lt;div /&amp;gt;').text(msg).html();
            // Add the message to the page.
            $('#discussion').append('&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;' + encodedName
                + '&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;' + encodedMsg + '&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;');
        };
        // Get the user name and store it to prepend to messages.
        $('#displayname').val(prompt('Enter your name:', ''));
        // Set initial focus to message input box.
        $('#message').focus();
        // Start the connection.
        $.connection.hub.start().done(function () {
            $('#sendmessage').click(function () {
                // Call the Send method on the hub.
                chat.server.send($('#displayname').val(), $('#message').val());
                // Clear text box and reset focus for next comment.
                $('#message').val('').focus();
            });
        });
    });
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there is one "?" thing before broadcastMessage function. That is where dynamic method is getting called. F# do not support dynamic by default but there are many work around available. I personally prefer &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Dynamic/"&gt;Fsharp.dynamic&lt;/a&gt; library. It is better than other code snippets I found over other sites. But that is all personal choice how one like to handle dynamic functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is done. Hit F5 and you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is fun of working with Web if I can't publish it. But for now with F# web templates it is not possible. And that is known &lt;a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpCommunityTemplates/issues/28"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;. So, if I like to publish it on cloud like azure I need to give git hooks. That is easiest thing I can think off. But road is still not that smooth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment will break with some weird error. I followed &lt;a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/08/26/running-a-pure-f-web-api-on-azure-web-sites/"&gt;Mark's article&lt;/a&gt; to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And things are working like anything. No, issues at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nancy |&gt; Razor |&gt; SignalR |&gt; Azure |&gt; F# |&gt; lots of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please give it a shot. If it break somewhere let me know will try to solve it. Any suggestion to make things even better and streamlined are always welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

Not only mobile development but it is doing a hell of a lot of thing other than mobile development. Not only that it is surely having wonderful history with &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/"&gt;JavaScript framework development&lt;/a&gt;. I don't have anything to complain against that. 
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
But today I am going to talk about specifically one framework, that is &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/"&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt;. I was trying to something that can developed once and deployed everywhere. &lt;em&gt;Yes, it is kinda new trend in mobile development now a days.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do have working experience with &lt;a href="http://jquerymobile.com/"&gt;JQuery Moblie&lt;/a&gt;, but still I choose Sencha, due to its performance and preference for architecture. I did same mistake which &lt;a href="http://datachomp.com/"&gt;Rob Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; mentioned couple of days back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kunjee"&gt;@kunjee&lt;/a&gt; it’s always a balance of being able to push yourself but make sure you don’t go over a cliff from the push.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rob Sullivan (@DataChomp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DataChomp/statuses/447559429353787392"&gt;March 23, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I practically pushed my self over the cliff. I am particularly having nothing against &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/"&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt;. It is nothing but the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; awesome product. May be problem is on my side. I am not &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; doing mobile work. Mobile application is part of bigger idea or bigger application. So, there are many other things than running that very same thing on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Framework should help and if I can't get it up and running in hours it is coming into my way of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same thing happened with me. I have tried &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/"&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt;, other than having lots of boiler plate code; Sencha command tool is also broken. That is also few months back there is no way to generate store using command. I never understand why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of programming which is ruling the market as of now. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"&gt;Object Oriented Programming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;. In latter one you can compose functions and normally code tends to stay small while is first one code is more so there is complete tooling chain around that. One of that is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;. If that is broken, there is no way I can write that much code and that also in JavaScript. Dynamic typing language is good if I can use that nature, if I am writing code like static typing that is like worst of both world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is already functionally object oriented language. If I am doing only object oriented part of it I need my tools up and running perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also tried &lt;a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/architect/"&gt;Sencha Architect&lt;/a&gt;. It is good for starting but after using for sometime, it started coming into my way. And I was spending more time in learning tool than solving the real problem. I personally don't like this kinda tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be I am not smart enough to use &lt;a href="http://www.sencha.com"&gt;Sencha&lt;/a&gt; products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend quite a amount of time learning Sencha, and same amount of time I was able complete application using more simpler &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/phonejs.devexpress.com"&gt;Phonejs&lt;/a&gt;. It is little slow at start up but at least I am not slowing down my application to get out of development state. &lt;/p&gt;

And again failed. And I am stopping it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are couple of reason of it. First and for most thing is I am not good at it. No where near even readable, I guess. Now, I don't know reason specifically for that. May be I can write on specific topic better instead of things that are continues.

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
And that is the reason complete series thing is not that good but individual write ups are getting good reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one more things. Few things are just very random that can't fit in series at all. Few days back I was trying to run SignalR with F#. I succeeded but that will not fit here. Before that there was article about &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/2014/02/servicestack-fsharp-template-starting-from-start/"&gt;getting started with Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; from very zero. And that also can't fit here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I finally though to kill it for while. Because of this I couldn't able to write few other things I like to write. I am putting this in this series as completely non-technical part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be more articles about web, game and F# but not in series form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, wait for next one. &lt;/p&gt;

It is pretty easy. Just install and run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as &lt;a href="http://servicestack.net/"&gt;Service Stack&lt;/a&gt; is moved to V4 with some breaking changes. I had give details about updating it. But still it is little bit more complicated or confusing if I can say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kunjee"&gt;@kunjee&lt;/a&gt; Sure, otherwise a tutorial on getting SS v4 + F# together without templates would be better than starting from a broken v3 one.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Demis Bellot (@demisbellot) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot/statuses/433545493738582016"&gt;February 12, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is the conversation inspired me to write this blog. And also it will be fun to write back stories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if any one want to get started with SS without templates. They need to download template of &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b55b8aac-b11a-4a6a-8a77-2153f46f4e2f"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the cousin sibling of SS and other best thing happen to web part of  .Net after .Net it self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create new project and select Empty ASP.Net option. And remove all other packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we are doing this just to save our self from using complicated project GUIDs. If any one wanted to go raw, s/he need to select library project in F# and set GUID so it will be web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now install, SS from nuget. Preferably with Asp.Net host. Use this &lt;code&gt;Install-Package servicestack.Host.AspNet&lt;/code&gt; . If any one prefer not search nuget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, delete every file with .cs extension. &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, we are doing it in &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, delete default.htm and *.js files. But keep the App_Start folder. We may need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is almost done. Now, create AppHost.fs in App_start folder. Write a namespace you like and copy paste below code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type AppHost() = 
    inherit AppHostBase("Hello F# Service", typeof&amp;lt;HelloService&amp;gt;.Assembly)
    override this.Configure container = ignore()
    static member start() = 
        let apphost = new AppHost()
        apphost.Init() |&amp;gt; ignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, create HelloService.fs outside somewhere. and copy paste below code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;lt;CLIMutable&amp;gt;]
    type HelloResponse = 
        { Result : string }


    [&amp;lt;Route("/hello")&amp;gt;]
    [&amp;lt;Route("/hello/{name}")&amp;gt;]
    type Hello() = 
        interface IReturn&amp;lt;HelloResponse&amp;gt;
        member val Name = "" with get, set


    type HelloService() = 
        inherit Service()
        member this.Any(request : Hello) = { Result = "Hello " + request.Name }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, final settings. Add global.asax.fs file. And copy - paste below code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Global() = 
    inherit System.Web.HttpApplication()

    member x.Application_Start (sender:Object, e:EventArgs) = 
        App_Start.AppHost.start() 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to add global.asax file too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add this line to it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Application Inherits="ServicestackAspNetHost.Global" %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do check for namespace name. This my project's namespace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may get error that couple of system references are missing. Please add them. I got for System.data and also for System.xml.linq&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;F# visual studio project is poor with compilation sequence. So, do keep open project file in your favorite text editor. If there is some error like "xyxy" is not defined. Most of the time it is compilation sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything builds. It is out first victory. Run it. It should show, metadata page of SS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is done for people just wanted to create back end for their single page application or mobile application or thick client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For complete web story lets add razor engine to it. Fire &lt;code&gt;Install-Package ServiceStack.Razor&lt;/code&gt; in package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Default.cshtml file. Add some html text to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here is complicated part. We can't add folder in F# projects. But as it is Asp.Net web project too, we can add Asp.Net project folder. Add one of the folder and rename it to &lt;em&gt;Views&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add two files. One is _Layout.cshtml and other is Hello.cshtml. Don't forget to set compile type content for all cshtml files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is content for _Layout.cshtml&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en-us"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;@ViewBag.Title&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style type="text/css"&amp;gt;
        body {
            background: #E6E6E6;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    @RenderBody()

    &amp;lt;h6 style="font-size:12px; color: #999; position: fixed; bottom: -25px; right: 10px;"&amp;gt;
        @Env.ServerUserAgent
    &amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is content for Hello.cshtml&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@using ServiceStackAspNetHost
@inherits ViewPage&amp;lt;HelloResponse&amp;gt; 
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
    ViewBag.Title = "Hello Page";
}

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    Hello Page
    &amp;lt;a href="/hello"&amp;gt;Default Hello&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href="/hello/fsharp"&amp;gt;Hello With get Request&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;


    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Model binding with DTO Response&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;@Model.Result&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much same as we do in C# projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are almost done. Now we need to tell AppHost to add razor plugin. Change code as below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;override this.Configure container =
            this.Plugins.Add(new RazorFormat())
            ignore()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, rebuild and run it. It will show default page on "/" location and Hello page on "/Hello" location. Even you can access metadata page too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that tough I guess. A little bit more code then normal one but as in F# it will be same as normal code in C#. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love SS that is true thing, but I love Nancy too. Will not lie on &lt;strong&gt;Valentine's Day&lt;/strong&gt;. Just to clarify as I used Nancy template to work with SS. If I have to do some web application work Nancy is weapon of choice and for API like thing SS is always there. People who created both are damn smart and more importantly friendly one. In .Net where OSS and OSS community story is not that good, these people are making the difference. Obviously I can't forget to mention F# community, they are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="http://blog.danielmohl.com/"&gt;Daniel Mohl&lt;/a&gt;, merged the pull request. Add the missing bits make it working and it is up on &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f"&gt;visual studio gallery&lt;/a&gt;. I seriously like to thank Daniel for this work and support even after his own hectic schedule of day job. And a wonderful members of &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; community. 
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
Here, I am sharing few details of the template, I have created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four templates available now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servicestack with Asp.Net host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servicestack with Asp.Net host and Razor Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servicestack with Self host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servicestack with Self host and Razor Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on Asp.Net MVC with Servicestack but then work in still progress. As, most of the people who are using servicestack can go with above options as Razor view engine now available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just try out all options and pick which suits for specific need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all templates are using &lt;strong&gt;3.71&lt;/strong&gt; version of SS. As, it is the last version under MIT license. Why I am using that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;oh dear, adding task to remove servicestack from solution &lt;a href="https://t.co/STpdEKQiJC"&gt;https://t.co/STpdEKQiJC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Simon Cousins (@simontcousins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simontcousins/statuses/408182117579776000"&gt;December 4, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are starting, or just like to stay with older version till the product kick off. They can continue with &lt;strong&gt;3.71&lt;/strong&gt;.  And else it is a wonderful solution, that is worth &lt;a href="https://servicestack.net/pricing"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do take care while fire up command of update-package without thinking a bit. If there is a need of using old version &lt;strong&gt;PLEASE&lt;/strong&gt; don't update it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if someone like to update from 3.71 to 4.X. There are couple of breaking changes there. Here are the steps to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the template from the &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f"&gt;Visual Studio gallery&lt;/a&gt; and install it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, it will also work with latest express version too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create new project and choose any template. Select OK. It is done. Easy enough right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press F5, and it will work with "Hello World" code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Code may seems little dirty. It misses comments and also read me. It will be there in future updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But current code is so less that it will be not that problematic to understand it. Obviously if you know &lt;a href="http://servicestack.net"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things needed to update the version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire a update command from nuget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are chances that one need to fire it more than one time, check package.config that all versions are updated to same version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove all the *.cs files and unwanted .htm, .js, .css files for now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now there will be some errors about namespace, remove unwanted namespace as code is merged to base namespace for many files
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove ServiceStack.ServiceInterface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove ServiceStack.ServiceHost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild it and run it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we get error about Razor pages, remove 1.0.0.0 version line from web config if there is 2.0.0.0 one is already there else change 1.0.0.0 to 2.0.0.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild and run it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now if there is a error "Object reference not set to an instance of an object." then we are on right track. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In AppHost.fs file replace &lt;code&gt;apphost.Init()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;apphost.Init() |&amp;gt; ignore&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This is breaking change for V4&lt;/strong&gt; please do not forget this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, we need out namespace so, remove "ServiceStackAspNetHost" with your desired project namespace in entire project including web.config file. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove any multiple entries of namespace from namespace section in web.cofig file. Do keep one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild and run it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should work. If still you stuck any where? I am also putting all V4 projects too, over my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunjee17/ServiceStackFSharp/tree/master/V4"&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;, have a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also started complete series called &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/category/functional-web/"&gt;Functional Web&lt;/a&gt;, where I will be putting everything I know to get started. Not only for SS but also for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as everyone is putting up API for their web application. Why we should stay behind?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback and comments are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hell, yes.. No XML... &lt;/p&gt;

There are many hatters of Visual Studio and its project file. I also don't mind sometimes joining the league. But for most of the cases it is doing many things, that we need to do otherwise.
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
And I am saying this because I have done this while creating templates for  &lt;a href="http://servicestack.net/"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt;. My first experience is damn flow less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created one sample application and &lt;a href="http://blog.danielmohl.com/"&gt;Daniel Mohl&lt;/a&gt; did the mojo jojo part. And template is up and running. But after that he was little bit busy with day job so I got that task. And first challenge was to run &lt;a href="http://servicestack.net/"&gt;Servicestack&lt;/a&gt; with F#. Console application is pretty easy as I have done it &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunjee17/ServiceStackHeroku"&gt;earlier too&lt;/a&gt; and deployed it to &lt;a href="http://servicestackheroku.herokuapp.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. But with Asp.Net it was giving weird issue. After struggling for two weeks and asking community over twitter, I got answer from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21213363/servicestack-razor-page-is-getting-added-to-content"&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;. Damn silly mistake. I copy pasted code from self host and that is spinning up two server. Once solved I was so happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But next thing is waiting for me is to make is template. I was having no idea how to do that. Other than I was having link where to give pull request. At this point &lt;a href="http://sidewaffle.com/"&gt;Side Waffle&lt;/a&gt; came to rescue. Just a 5 minutes video and you are done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I do got some hiccups, like I was unable to created project at first. But then I did &lt;em&gt;hacking&lt;/em&gt; , lamest one. Did copy paste of other working project, removed their data and insert mine. And it was working.  Obviously this was not the best way but for now it is working. And I am the happy one for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last I have given my first pull request to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;F# Community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; project. Yes, Yes, Yes... It is time for celebration. This can not be possible without a wonderful helping community over github, twitter, stackoverflow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But two things are certain from my experience that Yak Shaving is pain in a##, and &lt;a href="http://sidewaffle.com/"&gt;Side Waffle&lt;/a&gt; is flow less in saving it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will highly encourage people having .Net Open Source project, please do make template and provide the boiler plate code. It will be hell easy to get started in that way. And it will save time from doing initial set up to get up and started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  Currently I am putting together V4 templates at my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunjee17/ServiceStackFSharp"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.  And again facing issue to make Asp.Net version running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am waiting for my pull request to get accepted. Once done, do have a look. You will see that F# and Servicestack are made for each other. Both are strongly typed, believed in message driven design and async model of working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In current state where everyone is making API, this is most &lt;em&gt;viable&lt;/em&gt; option for .Net people to have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Template is currently having V3.71, it is still under MIT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if someone like to move to V4, that is also not that costly option for the worth Servicestack bringing to development. Once I ll get up and running V4, I will put the template of that too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Community members, if there are any suggestion, comments please do provide. And obviously I am happy to take pull request for my template projects too. Different combinations of Servicestack option will be great. Also, if someone can check out issue that will be also great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update2:&lt;/strong&gt;  Latest template is up at &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f"&gt;Visual Studio Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, now having asp.net host too. There are three additional templates. And also V4 issue is solved and project is working now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks F#, Servicestack and specially Side Waffle. &lt;/p&gt;

He had put a tremendous effort to make different kind of templates. Even starting from MVC3 till date now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old templates are like there are two projects one is C# and one is &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;. C# is having all the &lt;a href="http://vanilla-js.com/"&gt;Java Script&lt;/a&gt;, html, css and stuff while F# is having coding part.

&lt;p&gt;Old templates are like there are two projects one is C# and one is &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;. C# is having all the &lt;a href="http://vanilla-js.com/"&gt;Java Script&lt;/a&gt;, html, css and stuff while F# is having coding part. 
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
But with time pass and version update, now we are having pure F# templates. A single project of F# having code, Java Script, cshtml, html, CSS everything. It is far more fun and easy to get started with. At the end of day F# is all about compressing code. Doing more with less code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Scala people, play is almost same as MVC framework. If you are following, code will be almost same only. I will still try to put code snippets wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you haven't downloaded template yet. Please check out my previous post the first one in series and download template. Once installed you are up and running to write some MVC code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am assuming that people trying this; is quite familiar with MVC and other concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I will be doing one to one map between C# and F# code. Just to get familiar with syntax. Then will move to optimized code to make it more functional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Note&lt;/strong&gt; If you are not having Visual Studio Pro or higher one. Do not worry, templates are working with Express versions also. As per latest release F# is now primarily supported by &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/use/windows/"&gt;Desktop and Web Express version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install template, create new project with MVC5 and Web API option. Hit F5 and it is done. You are up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling great?!? It is just started.

&lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; for a long is treated as second class citizen in main stream programming in .Net area. But now it is picking up the pace. When I decided to write a complete series of web development with I was even thinking like that only. There will be C# project and &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; project. C# project will take care of UI and F# project will do all the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thanks to wonderful community of &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;, we have now pure templates. And that is the point of start. Complete web development using &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org/"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; only. Nothing can be more fun that this. And it is not ended here, there are testing , mocking , testing libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this series, I will try to check out every vertical of web development. Including deployment to cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will also make sure to keep posting details about Scala and &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; too, in compare to &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with &lt;strong&gt;Hello World&lt;/strong&gt;. Go to the visual studio gallery and download the templates and add-on for &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; web development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f1dae7fe-1ecc-4f1b-86b5-32a2970d012a"&gt;F# web templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing these template and add on will give you nice ways to start. Trust me I am enjoying far more after these pure &lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; templates arrived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For people who is new to language, I will start from simple conversation of OOP to Functional programming. Most of them is one to one map only. So, there will be less use of pure functional concept. But slowly will move to more functional style of programming. And trying to achieve nirvana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People trying Scala or coming from Java background &lt;a href="http://www.playframework.com/"&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt; is choice of framework for you. It is supported by wonderful community and build over the ever powerful &lt;a href="http://akka.io/"&gt;AKKA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who don't like types or coming from Ruby like language background. You can Clojure for you. And here is twitter conversation with &lt;a href="http://bodil.org/"&gt;Bodil&lt;/a&gt; for the selection of framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kunjee"&gt;@kunjee&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;m a bit out of touch, used to prefer straight Ring + Compojure, maybe Aleph. But that was before both core.async and Pedestal...&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bodil Stokke (@bodil) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bodil/statuses/431086156470833152"&gt;February 5, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For People who is going with F# / scala; there are couple of reference reading for getting started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/"&gt;F# for fun and profit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.jessitron.com/"&gt;Jessica Kerr's blog for Scala lovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do have a look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; : - I am neither expert of &lt;em&gt;web&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;functional programming&lt;/em&gt;. But I know web a little bit more than other programming things and I love functional programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are we waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kunjan.in/images/rock.gif" alt="rock" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lets rock. &lt;/p&gt;

And trust me I am no where near poetic part. I have good grip over language but that is only for my mother tongue. I am quite comfortable with English but still no where near having artistic touch. Or in simple language my database of words is not that strong. But normally I am able to convey my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say, I am pretty lucky in the case of writing poems. Though I have write only few, many of them got good review from whom so ever read it. But that charm doesn't last that much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a poem for my &lt;a href="http://kunjan.in/2012/04/i-miss-you-sister/"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt; and it don't get any kind of review. I do got personal message from sister after a long time that "it was sweet". But that all because she is my sister. Personally if I like to give review to my this poem it is not good at all. There are tsunami of feeling I wanted to convert and I just converted drops of it. And at that moment I decided, will never write poem; at least never in public.

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
I do write sometimes, but that is all personal on personal request. And I will not say that poem too. They are just few lines, I crafted for person requested. Like few hand picked words, that's it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the time I got request to write more poems. So, I decided to take a course at &lt;a href="https://class.coursera.org/songwriting-004"&gt;coursera&lt;/a&gt; and with that I like to take opinion of others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should I write more poems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please write whatever you think in comments. And help me to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

And seriously don't blame them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue is mainly Functional Programming stays in back ground only. If you see any starting example of any functional language is mainly some machine learning example or some complicated algorithm example. And that may effect normal people to getting started with Functional Programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But functional programming can do far more than that. And that include simple things too. And I means it can make thing simpler or I can say it can make easy thing simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, if I say have to put web case here. May be web is right now most appropriate place where functional programming can be used. And reason is damn simple, current web projects are getting bigger and bigger and user base is also getting even larger. Now, to support that hardware is also getting better and better.

And reason is damn simple, current web projects are getting bigger and bigger and user base is also getting even larger. Now, to support that hardware is also getting better and better. 
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
Now, the only thing is there is a need of programming language that can use this kind of hardware. And this case Functional Programming comes in picture or I must say it is most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there are many things that are backed into the language that help with the situation. If I take one thing is immutability. As there are grid of processors, there is a need of multiple objects using the resource parallel and there will be need to manage state of the objects. With immutability there will be no state that can be mutated. So, it is very much easy to reason with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately we don't utilize functional programming that much. And may be that is the reason we don't know how easy and beautiful things code can be with the use of functional programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here I will be writing couple of articles or may be series to make a case how useful functional programming can be in the case of web development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As, I am mainly from the .Net background I ll be talking about F# mostly. But the thing is, functional programming is not limited to that. If anyone is coming from the Java land, &lt;a href="http://www.playframework.com/"&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; is the language for you. And if anyone wants something dynamic and very near to LISP, &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt; is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to get taste of every possible language, few sample here and there. But things mainly will be for Functional programming and Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that effort count.&lt;/p&gt;
