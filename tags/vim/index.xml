      <description>I want confess that, my whole career I was and I am working with Visual Studio. Not a big fan, but it was good or I must say it is good. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any other IDE is doing as much thing as visual studio is doing.
And with few add-ons (even if you exclude ReSharper) it is like wow. As full time web developer I like the tools, that always there to solve my issue.</description>
