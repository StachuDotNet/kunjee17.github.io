      <description>I am in Bangalore, and first thing I found here classically well is coffee. Obviously I will not going to talk about coffee here. But about CoffeeScript which is as good as coffee . I come to know about CoffeeScript from the article written by Scott Hanselman . And I become addicted to it. I am not much a web guy. I like coding but mostly on server end. And Visual Studio is always there to save me.</description>
