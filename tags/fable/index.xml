      <description>Nothing can be more beautiful if you wish come. And It seems Fable2 did made my wish true in most of the cases. Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit my old blog and check what is got improved and changed. So, goal of this blog is it should be same as old blog, but it should be smaller. Because of new and shiny Fable2.
 Fable 2 is currently in beta but as per blog it is very much working.</description>

      <description>There can&amp;rsquo;t be better time for writing this blog. As Fable 2.0 is on the horizon it would be good to see what 1.0 already can do. And I can also wish few things to be added to 2.0.
I have chosen Fable after evaluating couple of options like TypeScript-React-Redux, Elm, Aurelia, Angular. One thing I was pretty much sure that I wanted static typing in my project. Because I did have first hand experience with big fat Angular application built using JavaScript.</description>
