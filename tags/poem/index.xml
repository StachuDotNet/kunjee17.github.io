      <description>Few words dedicated to people who made me who I am right now, my teachers. I know few of them personally and few others I am yet to meet in person. But they are still there always for me. Guiding me and helping me whenever and wherever I need. Words are not enough to say Thanks but still here with my small try
Here is original Gujarati Version

      <description>I never thought I would make this public. I wrote long back for one of my dear cousin. It was relevant then. But it is more relevant now. One of my best friend, batch mate, college mate, colleague at one point of time, rommie is now moving to another country. With a aim to never looking back for all the good reasons.
Andrew Vyas this is for you. You are one of the friend I never wanted because I knew one day time flew and you or me will move on and that may be good for future but at point it is utterly painful.</description>

      <description>Long back I have tried my hand to writing poems. And trust me I am no where near poetic part. I have good grip over language but that is only for my mother tongue. I am quite comfortable with English but still no where near having artistic touch. Or in simple language my database of words is not that strong. But normally I am able to convey my feelings.
I can say, I am pretty lucky in the case of writing poems.</description>

      <description>First friend I found was you
First enemy I found was you
First fight I had was with you
First person I always miss is you
I miss you, my dear sister
Beating me was your favorite game
Teasing me with different names
Remaining is now, only the pain
Not being with you, I feel mundane
I miss you, my dear sister
You are Dad’s favorite
You are Mom’s favorite</description>

      <description>Its wonderful morning
Sun is waiting to rise
It’s waiting for you sun shine
Waiting for your wonderful smile
Birds wake up
Songs are waiting to be sung
Beats are waiting for you sun shine
Waiting for your dazzling smile
Air just started moving
Breeze just wanted to spread
Fragrance is waiting for you sun shine
Waiting for your mesmerizing smile
Pen is ready to write
Ink is desperate to draw</description>
