      <description>If you ever involved in web development, then you must be knowing the history of it. Once upon a time there is something called CGI. And at that moment there are static html pages.
Only few part of page is dynamic. Then things changed, ASP came. Server access become so normal and easy. But still there is a lot more work to do. And main issue with them is code is not arranged and coding style is not suitable for big projects.</description>
