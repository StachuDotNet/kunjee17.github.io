      <description>I had seen one T-shirt where developer and programmer are erased coder is written below it. I just remember that and was thinking, why so.
Answer is just with me. Every time we start work, and first thing we do is to hit Google. Copy and paste code and make things work. Never bother our self why code is working like that only and why I am copying this only. 60 people out of 100 are doing the same.</description>
