      <description>Whenever something came from Microsoft or Microsoft employee there is always a buzz… And I still don’t understand why person’s company policies do with person’s attitude or approach of a person. Same happens when typescript came. It was just a day old and Open Source People starts bashing it like anything. Comparing with CoffeeScript , Dart . Guys, it is also open source and Microsoft in any case not forcing anything.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I have written about some JavaScript basics from the point of view of Software Engineering and Architecture. In this post I will stay close to metal. I will talk about few things we should care about JavaScript language. Things that’s should be or shouldn’t be in the code.
I am from hard core compile language background. My first company is Game Company where I have built kind of Game Engine and second company I work on C++.</description>

      <description>Long back I have wrote a article on CoffeeScript . If anyone see closely its all about writing proper Java Script in easy way. But in many cases its not possible that you got chance to write CoffeeScript . Or if you are learning some library like KnockoutJS or BackboneJS , also if you are using some framework like AngularJS . Than using CoffeeScript and also using this function to learn than it will be difficult to catch up together.</description>
