      </h1> 
      
      <p>Oops, I used “Duffer” instead of “Dummy” because I am one of it.</p>

<p>I installed OS nearly 8 times to get what I wanted from Windows 8. I brought new Dell Ultra book and first thing I have done is to install consumer preview, second thing installing VS2012. And I meet my first issue, it is not allowed so I need to use trial version, so another format and new OS in.</p>

<p>Here, I have made another mistake to install it in SSD, I thought I put OS there and all other things in other drive. As, at that point of time I really don’t know why on the earth that 32 GB SSD is there. It is fast but what I do with that. As, it was not showing at the time, when default Windows 7 was there. OK, it goes as per plan and my system things got better and better but my drive got screwed big time. Always I need to watch that is it full or not.</p>

<p>Than I got mail that Pro version is available. Wow, I just loved that news. So, first thing first learn about SSD and I got wonderful <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1227655/how-to-set-up-intel-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching">article</a> written by Sean. Ok, now I know that SSD for caching only. Here, issue again that I need to order first as direct download of ISO is not available. Damn is seriously don’t like this.</p>

<p>To, do that I need to reinstall Windows 7 and then I started the process using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/upgrade-offer">upgrade wizard</a> . I ordered my brand new Windows 8 Pro and started downloading. Then there is wizard come that give me option to create a ISO for that. I selected that. And then I have created my boot USB.</p>

<p>Ok, things seems good up till now. But when I change my mode to SATA ACHI to RAID, drive is not showing up only. I installed in ACHI and try to change again but giving me error that drive where windows is locked. Just feeling like I am road end. Then I have done some Google, but sadly couldn’t found any perfect solution. That keep me thinking how to give them driver even before installing of windows.</p>

<p>Now, time came where one should trust books and basics instead of Google God. Drivers are sys files which allows you to load hardware, it is not exe, out file its below that which contains definition of the hardware. So, I went to dell site and download drivers. I extracted on my other machine, put it on USB from where I am installing OS. At the time of installation I clicked load drivers, unchecked for singed drivers only check-box and I got the list of drivers available. I selected the RAID one and magic works. Drive list arrives to complete the installation. Later things is kids stuff, next next and Windows 8 up and running. [NOTE: You need key to do the installation. I don’t find trial option in there. ]</p>

<p>Now, time to use SSD, just install all the application from Dell [In case of other vendors use your respective site or Intel site] and you will get Rapid Storage software running, just enable Caching there for your hard disk using SSD. Its done. A cool OS is ready to use.</p>

<p>Download aaps, Visual Studio are running. Its done. Enjoy the change.</p>

        <span>posted on 08 Oct 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Whenever something came from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> employee there is always a buzz… And I still don’t understand why person’s company policies do with person’s attitude or approach of a person. Same happens when <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> came. It was just a day old and Open Source People starts bashing it like anything. Comparing with <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> , <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> . Guys, it is also open source and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> in any case not forcing anything. As of now. If you like use it if you don’t just don’t use it. </p>

<p>In any case it is just a <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . There is very positive buzz when <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> came. But for <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> was not that fortunate.</p>

<p>It is normal. Even I thought just another things come from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> that is similar to <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . But I was wrong it is far different than <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . I am in long time relationship with typed language like C-*, JAVA and recently fall in love with Ruby like language. So, I kinda like both. I don’t have problem with any. Whenever I am learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I like to code with <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and even I started using with my day to day work in .Net. But there is no symmetry in that. I am missing that. And typescript came to solve that issue. Obviously some people claim that they don’t need good tool but still I wonder how can a person make enterprise level language using notepad.</p>

  <p>Check out comments section over this blog :  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">Typescript</a> is just provide type to <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . And with that it provides tooling support to writing client side code. Nothing else. Even it is not trying to bring good parts of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> to you. Like <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . Not forcing anything and also not doing any magic behind. So, you can say it is very near to metal, pure <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . And I like and also dislike this thing. I like this because it allows me copy paste and I have it because it also allows bad parts of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> to production code. I personally like <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> for a reason that it doesn’t allows any bad parts but restrict / force you to write good parts only. Again this is personal view and like. I am not that good with <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> so I prefer writing code in <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> which take care of every other things and emit a beautiful <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . </p>

<p>But a person who is good with <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> or believed to be good with <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">Typescript</a> is for them. It is wonderful thing which provides complete freedom of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> with types to help you out.<br />
So, lets check out what the hell <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> is.</p>

<p>I have special relationship with this. Because this is the first language I have read language specification. Huff its nasty. At first shot I haven’t got a single thing. But than when I am in the state of understanding that its just wow. I just loved it. I should have read language specification with Pro Books. I personally insist to visit site and check out <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> , a wonderful introduction video is there. And lots of samples are also available too. Also, there is <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267238">specification</a> available. It is nice, must read book.</p>

<p>If you are lazy genius than you should continue reading. I will try to cover as much possible of <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> .</p>

<p>Basically you can just bounce <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> into <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> just like that. It will work because of dynamic data type “any”. But just like dynamic keyword of C# it will not provide intellesense support. But I think its fine it you using some <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267238">JQuery</a> plug in just to do some UI effect or something like that.</p>

<p>Type script has <strong>module</strong> keyword to define namespace. In that module you can bounce classes, functions, interface or var. If any of that which is not exported or public in case of functions than that is private to that module. And module is public/global variable. So, everything within that is exported using module pattern. Here is sample directly taken from <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> site. </p>

<p>module Sayings { 
    export class Greeter { 
      greeting: string ; 
      constructor (message: string ) { 
        this .greeting = message; 
      } 
      greet() { 
      return "Hello, " + this .greeting; } 
      } 
    } 
    var greeter = new Sayings.Greeter( "world" ); 
    var button = document.createElement( 'button' ) 
    button.innerText = "Say Hello"; 
    button.onclick = function () { 
      alert(greeter.greet()) 
    } 
    document.body.appendChild(button) </p>

<p>That will generate java script as shown below.</p>

<p>var Sayings; 
  ( function (Sayings) { 
    var Greeter = ( function () { 
      function Greeter(message) { 
        this .greeting = message; 
        } 
        Greeter.prototype.greet = function () { 
        return "Hello, " + this .greeting; }; 
        return Greeter; })(); 
        Sayings.Greeter = Greeter; })
        (Sayings || (Sayings = {})); 
        var greeter = new Sayings.Greeter( "world" ); 
        var button = document.createElement( 'button' ); 
        button.innerText = "Say Hello" ; 
        button.onclick = function () { 
          alert(greeter.greet()); }; 
        document.body.appendChild(button); </p>

<p>Lovely I guess. So, this is basic <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> , its nothing but a <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> with class. So, I don’t copy paste more example here, but talk about few things I like about type script. And you can always visit a site to check out. If you have read my <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">coffeescript</a> article, it was longgggggg… but in that there is lot to cover. If I started writing that much about <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> it will be <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> class only.</p>

<p>So, here is a small list of things I like about <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> </p>

<ul>
<li>It provide support for number,string, array and dynamic function</li>
<li>Easy to integrate with external java script library</li>
<li>one can create or export declaration file to provide intellisense support</li>
<li>module, classes, private/public functions are just super awesome as it feels like typed language</li>
<li>interface support is there, just another add in to dynamic language to make programming like anything</li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> , JQueryUI, Win8 files are available in samples, I guess best way to learn <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> , just fire a command, and be sure that you will not get spelling mistakes </li>
<li>AMD and Module pattern is default in build so, there classes are ready use with framework like <a href="http://www.requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> . //I seriously want this with CoffeeScript </li>
<li>Miserable “this” keyword is getting handled nicely</li>
<li>Very less change in your written functions and generated <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> functions. //At some point I don’t like this as it allows bad parts in your functions </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously I don’t like few things about <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> too.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is allowing bad code, even like comparison operator is not getting corrected like other counterparts.</li>
<li>Easy to go wrong as it provides free will to put step out side the boundary as it not force you for that</li>
<li>It is not sweet like <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">coffeescript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Comments and corrections are always welcome. But I strongly recommended not to bash company or new born language. I am not working in Microsoft but we are leaving in free world and <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">Typescript</a> is open source under apache license.</p>

        <span>posted on 17 Sep 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>In my previous <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/java-script-diary-1">post</a> I have written about some <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> basics from the point of view of Software Engineering and Architecture. In this post I will stay close to metal. I will talk about few things we should care about <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> language. Things that’s should be or shouldn’t be in the code.</p>

<p>I am from hard core compile language background. My first company is Game Company where I have built kind of Game Engine and second company I work on C++. Even in third company I was working on web project but most of the time I stay on the server end. So, I have support of managed nature of C Sharp. But in case of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> it is not true. And many time people makes mistakes what I did. Take <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> as compiled language and work like that only. Obviously its like other programming languages only, its all about if and else but its little bit different. My this post is going to be completed by the video of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> . Here I am attaching video, too. Please go through the video and checkout what should be taken care while writing <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . Its 50 minutes long and obviously worth spending 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Here is the video.</p>

<iframe style="height:544px;width:960px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/OPN08/player?w=960&h=544" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" ></iframe>

<p><strong>So, here is details that are showed in video.</strong> </p>

<p>Please go through this. Its worth watching and learning.</p>

        <span>posted on 05 Sep 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Long back I have wrote a article on <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . If anyone see closely its all about writing proper Java Script in easy way. But in many cases its not possible that you got chance to write <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . Or if you are learning some library like <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> , also if you are using some framework like <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> . Than using <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and also using this function to learn than it will be difficult to catch up together. If you are not powerful enough with one of either.</p>

<p>And as a base rule. Even you are using <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> , you are not escaping from <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . It was there and it will be there for future for sure. So, It is worth learning it. If you have read previous article you must know that I am not that good with <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . So, I started learning and also thought for note I should put that to a blog. Whatever I learn will document on my blog. So, that will helpful to others and specially for me.</p>

<p>Most of the guys must be knowing many things. But that’s fine, its again for personal reference.</p>

<p><a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> is very flexible language. And this allows you to write lovely code without worrying about many things. But again this makes issue many times. And every damn time I will end up messing with that flexibility issue. <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9S0vNlm41AY/URHJtukdwUI/AAAAAAAAArI/blHsaJPrt_c/s800/flexible_4.jpg"> <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9S0vNlm41AY/URHJtukdwUI/AAAAAAAAArI/blHsaJPrt_c/s800/flexible_4.jpg" alt="flexible" /></a> </p>

<p>And first thing starts with Global variable. In <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> everything is global by default. So, whenever you are writing any function just like that, they are globally accessible. This is an issue. Just like static variable in any other language. So, don’t write functions just like that. Out anywhere on page. Simple solution of this is self executable anonymous function. That will make everything private. And that’s good at some point at least better than putting everything global. Here everything is private and executed. Just check out the example. </p>

<pre><code>(funciton{ 
  var dosomething = function (){ 
  //Here I am doing something 
  } 
})(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Here do something is completely private. But sometime we need some thing in global. We need to access it from outside. Then there are two patterns for that. Module Pattern and Revealing Module Pattern. I personally prefer Revealing Module Patter. So, I am giving demo for that.</p>

<pre><code>var REVEALING; 
  REVEALING = ( function () { 
    var dosomething = function (){ 
      //Here I am doing something 
      } 
      var dosomethingmore = function (){ 
      // here I am accessing dosomething 
    function dosomething(); 
    } 
  return 
    {   
    dosomethingmore:dosomethingmore 
    //here only one function is exposed 
    //so it is the only function available outside this namespace 
    } 
})(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Here one more thing comes in a picture. Namespace, which are not available by default in <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> .</p>

<p>As namespace is not there, we are missing classes too. As <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> is a functional language, it only has functions, also as available as Objects. So, if you like to make things like classes, internally they are functions only. And you also can create constructor based functions too.</p>

<pre><code>var Dosomething = ( 
  function (){ 
    function Dosomething(parametername)   
    this.parametername = parametername; 
})(); 
</code></pre>

<p>So, now we have our lovely constructor with parameter. While calling this we can just do like this</p>

<p><code>var dosomethingobject = new Dosomething( "namehere" );</code> </p>

<p>And after that we can call whatever functions we like to call. It will use the parameter. This is also having same benefit as we are getting with parameterized constructor in structured language. So, this small things always helps to write more readable code.</p>

<p>One another things worth nothing here. It is that we can write anything anywhere in <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> does not mean that we should go for that. Even in <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> Single Responsibility Principal should be followed.</p>

<p>And also parameter name and function name should be self describing. Just because <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> is giving freedom we just use it like that.</p>

<p>There are many library and other corner cases that can be consider while development client side JavaScript application. But that will be in next time.</p>

<p>Till then happy coding…</p>

First fight I had was with you<br />
First person I always miss is you<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>Beating me was your favorite game<br />
Teasing me with different names<br />
Remaining is now, only the pain<br />
Not being with you, I feel mundane<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>You are Dad’s favorite<br />
You are Mom’s favorite<br />
But you know you are also my favorite<br />
Then why you became someone else’s favorite<br />
I miss you, my dear sister  </p>

<p>Achievements are just made for you<br />
Success always waiting for you<br />
Even world is following you<br />
But you know at home, someone still waiting for you<br />
I miss you, my dear sister   </p>

<p>You went to school made new friends<br />
You went to college made new friends<br />
I go to school, you are my friend<br />
I go to college, you are my friend<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>I know you want to shine and never fade<br />
Want to study and always be ahead<br />
Want to work hard and move forward<br />
But once look back, and then move forward<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>Time doesn’t stop, neither do you<br />
You are busy with time for only few<br />
I am still at doorstep, eagerly waiting for you<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>You got married, had a new life<br />
Few more smiles because of you,<br />
A new sunrise shines your new life<br />
But what will I do without you<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>My life is incomplete without you<br />
My poem is incomplete without you   </p>

      <p>I am in Bangalore, and first thing I found here classically well is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a>. Obviously I will not going to talk about coffee here. But about <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> which is as good as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a> . I come to know about <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> from the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CoffeeScriptSassAndLESSSupportForVisualStudioAndASPNETWithTheMindscapeWebWorkbench.aspx">article</a> written by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> . And I become addicted to it. I am not much a web guy. I like coding but mostly on server end. And Visual Studio is always there to save me. But when it comes to Java Script, I just crash land any time. I always try to go back to server as soon as possible. Obviously <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> is there to bail me out. But still it is only for DOM, but for other things, you have to be expert. Now, here expert means whose written <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> pass the <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> with minimum errors. Simple functions and doing some addition is not a big deal but making a library for web application is do a big deal. At least for me. I am so rigid about my code quality and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> is a damn flexible scripting language which easy become a sloppy for me. I always try to follow architecture define by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">Java Script Good Parts</a> . But at the end following some rules in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C Sharp</a> is easy than follow in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a>. But God is with me. I found a friend who is damn powerful in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> .</p>

<p>She is princess of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . She write JS like any thing. And standards are not violated at all. I don’t know how someone can write code like that. She is like <a href="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/">Cynthia Rothrock</a> of Web. <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Dw-LumABw0Q/URHJoqyQPlI/AAAAAAAAApY/hnY4qIE8wAE/s800/CR_2.jpg" alt="" /> </p>

<p>Yeah, she is like her only. Just like photo. A girl you don’t want to mess with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am not that another person in picture. It just a FYI.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/">Cynthia Rothrock</a> she is also a black belt but in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . Always kicking around in web arena. Whenever I stuck somewhere she comes laugh at me and solve the problem. And what I am in compare to her, like kid shown here. <img src="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/" alt="](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TwrCb<em>2KLk0/URHJyRifiTI/AAAAAAAAAsk/V7mr0dHwQ3o/s800/kids-gi</em>thumb.jpg)  A white belt kid. Now what I can do to match the standards with her. Technically I can’t. As she is black belt and I am just a kid. But I am a smart kid. I drink some [coffee" /> and write <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> . Yeah, you have black belt and I have <a href="http://www.cynthiarothrock.org/">coffee</a> . Now, I come to point. There is always a need of writing good code, weather it is compiled language or a scripting language.</p>

<p>And good code has two main quality as per me. One is its readability and another is extendibility. If I am writing code, other should read it and also able to extend it. Now, if you are writing <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> like her, others don’t find any problem to read or extend it but else that will be a problem specifically with scripting languages. It prone to get dirty soon.</p>

<p>Here, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> has major advantage. First thing its readability, and second thing it is just a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . Here, I am going to use few example from <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> site only. So, if you like to try it out, site have try <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> option, I encouraged you to do that.</p>

<p>To try <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeeScript</a> on local machine there are few options to go with. Today most of the IDE supports add on for <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> . But I prefer the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> way. Just install it and start firing commands. You can check out home site for <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> to starts with. I am now starting with example.</p>

<p>First thing I love about CoffeeScript is call back function. It wrapper your code around <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> callback function by default. Here is Hello World example of it. I first go with Java Script</p>

<pre><code>(function () { 
  alert( "this is coffee Script" ); 
}).call( this );
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty small things. But I forget many times. This will call anonymous function to self so it will not mess with other libraries around. And what I wrote in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> file. Just one line </p>

<pre><code>alert "this is coffee Script" 
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. That all I wanted to do. No more function and all that, no more brackets; nothing. Just like any other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_language">DSL</a> , just write what I like to do. It is pretty basic example but even from start, it is showing the power of <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> .</p>

<p>Another thing I like is working with arrays. After having list and collection in new languages, working with array is little bit difficult sometime. My friend mention above wrote complete library to get functionality like List in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . But it is fun to write array in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> .</p>

<p>Normally we do things in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> like shown here </p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var food, foods, _i, _len;

  foods = ['broccoli', 'spinach', 'chocolate'];

  for (_i = 0, _len = foods.length; _i &lt; _len; _i++) {
  food = foods[_i];
  if (food !== 'chocolate') {
      eat(food);
  }
  }

}).call(this); 
</code></pre>

<p>But in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>  </p>

<pre><code>foods = ['broccoli', 'spinach', 'chocolate']
eat food for food in foods when food isnt 'chocolate'
</code></pre>

<p>Its just pure fun. Here there are few things I like to mentions specifically. First thing I have already mentioned is how to do array thing in fun way. Other thing if you have noticed is a loop with “_” variables. <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> takes care of everything starting from scoping of variable by it self. If you need to mentions at top or take care that it will not go out of scope. That will be taken care, even simple thing like loop is written in way it should be written.</p>

<p>Another example for looping</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> it is like </p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var countdown, num;

  countdown = (function() {
  var _i, _results;
  _results = [];
  for (num = _i = 10; _i &gt;= 1; num = --_i) {
      _results.push(num);
  }
  return _results;
  })();

}).call(this);
</code></pre>

<p>And in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> it is like a one line, giving For Each loop feeling in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . </p>

<p>countdown = (num for num in [10..1])</p>

<p>So, Here there is one another benefit. If I am insisting for <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> , it is not against the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> but in favor of learning it. One will know the right way of writing <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . As per site of <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> , <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> generated by it passed the <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> without a single error. So, it is good to learn <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> using <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> .</p>

<p>Now, if any one is fan of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> , it supports <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> like syntax in few cases. Obviously web club will like this. You can pass inline variable with “#” and it will work. Let me show you the example.</p>

<p>This time I will go with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> first </p>

<pre><code>yearsOld = max: 10, ida: 9, tim: 11

ages = for child, age of yearsOld
  "#{child} is #{age}"
</code></pre>

<p>And here is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> for it </p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var age, ages, child, yearsOld;

    yearsOld = {
    max: 10,
    ida: 9,
    tim: 11
    };

    ages = (function() {
    var _results;
    _results = [];
    for (child in yearsOld) {
        age = yearsOld[child];
        _results.push("" + child + " is " + age);
    }
return _results;
  })();

}).call(this);
</code></pre>

<p>See it take pretty good care of every damn thing. I just fall in love of this. Pushing everything over the top and returning result, changing things with appropriate variables. Every damn thing. Isn’t it good ???</p>

<p>There are few more things for conditional operators and looping. But I like to move on to little bit complex example. If I want to create library like <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> , few more things must be there. Now, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> doesn’t have private , public things or classes by default. In <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> functions are the classes it self. And there is a trick to do private public thing in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . Most of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> programmer must have known this. But this thing is fairly easy in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> . It has its own class syntax and there you go. Code like any other higher level language. Just check it out.</p>

<p>CoffeeScript Code</p>

<pre><code>class Animal
  constructor: (@name) -&gt;

  move: (meters) -&gt;
  alert @name + " moved #{meters}m."
</code></pre>

<p>class Snake extends Animal
      move: ->
      alert "Slithering..."
    super 5</p>

<pre><code>class Horse extends Animal
  move: -&gt;
  alert "Galloping..."
  super 45

sam = new Snake "Sammy the Python"
tom = new Horse "Tommy the Palomino"

sam.move()
tom.move()
</code></pre>

<p>And here is Java Script code ( </p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var Animal, Horse, Snake, sam, tom,
__hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty,
__extends = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (__hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; };

  Animal = (function() {

  function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  Animal.prototype.move = function(meters) {
    return alert(this.name + (" moved " + meters + "m."));
  };

  return Animal;

  })();

  Snake = (function(_super) {

__extends(Snake, _super);

function Snake() {
  return Snake.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
}

Snake.prototype.move = function() {
  alert("Slithering...");
  return Snake.__super__.move.call(this, 5);
};

return Snake;

  })(Animal);

  Horse = (function(_super) {

__extends(Horse, _super);

function Horse() {
  return Horse.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
}

Horse.prototype.move = function() {
  alert("Galloping...");
  return Horse.__super__.move.call(this, 45);
};

return Horse;

  })(Animal);

  sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");

  tom = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");

  sam.move();

  tom.move();

}).call(this);
</code></pre>

<p>Isn’t it cool ?? I guess it is. Making library becomes so easy with this kind of syntax. Obviously for the person like me who is from another language background.</p>

<p>Let us see some more complex example. Of function binding. It is easy to bind function. No, extra code at all. </p>

<pre><code>Account = (customer, cart) -&gt;
  @customer = customer
  @cart = cart

  $('.shopping_cart').bind 'click', (event) =&gt;
  @customer.purchase @cart
</code></pre>

<p>And it will generate appropriate Java Script</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var Account;

  Account = function(customer, cart) {
  var _this = this;
  this.customer = customer;
  this.cart = cart;
  return $('.shopping_cart').bind('click', function(event) {
    return _this.customer.purchase(_this.cart);
  });
  };

}).call(this);
</code></pre>

<p>See. It is fun. If you are thinking that what if you are <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> fan like me. Again I like to repeat word from <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> only</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's just JavaScript</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use any library with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> . Let’s check out one of the example of it.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> code </p>

<pre><code>show_message = (msg) -&gt; 
  $('#message').hide().text(msg).fadeIn(2222, -&gt; $('#message').append('!'))

$ -&gt; 
  show_message "world"
  $('#message').click -&gt; show_message "you"
</code></pre>

<p>And here we go with <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> code </p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var show_message;

    show_message = function(msg) {
    return $('#message').hide().text(msg).fadeIn(2222, function() {
    return $('#message').append('!');
  });
  };

  $(function() {
  show_message("world");
  return $('#message').click(function() {
    return show_message("you");
  });
  });

}).call(this);
</code></pre>

<p>It becomes more powerful when it joins hands with <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> or other libraries.</p>

<p>Now, for whom this is ??? This is for person like me. Or even black belt like my friend. It just fun to write <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> . I don’t insist to use it but I surely insist to give it a try. It is worth investing time in it. Again if you are die hard <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> developer, I don’t think you need this. But again there is no loss in learning new thing. I am just enjoying <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> like anything.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" alt="](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-x7ptaCkB7bA/URHJvRJbFMI/AAAAAAAAArw/dvsN8HvY0I4/s800/iStock<em>000005133061XSmall</em>2.jpg) So, here there are clearly two options for most of the developers including me. Either I can have coffee with [Java Script" /> , doing over time and solving errors. Or I can use <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> and have fun time with my (Black belt) friend. I prefer later one. And trust me this is one the most fun writing article just like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> .</p>

<p>Taste a coffee and have fun. Coding is seriously enjoyable with friends like her and technology like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> . Special thanks to Jeremy Ashkenas for giving <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> .</p>

<p>Enjoy Coffee!!!</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>I am not much a writer kind of person. If you drop a math puzzle, probably I will do it in better way. But sometimes it is necessity to do thing even though you are not good at it. Just like this Open Letter. <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> is wonderful endeavor from <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and one of his friend <a href="http://averyblog.com/">James Avery</a> . I know <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> because of <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> .</p>

<p>You can consider me in his fan club, if he is having one. I don’t know of it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, Rob. Do you have any fan club like thing ??? I really like to join one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here in India, every other teacher expect student to be like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna">Arjuna</a> , because of his concentration and dedication towards the learning or work. But the person they forget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a> . And Rob sir is providing that opportunity to world to learn like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a> . Learning from distance and prove your worthy.</p>

<p><a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> is having open house for a weekend. And first thing I have done is watching a video of a programming wizard, genius developer and classic speaker <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> . I was waiting for this from a long time. Actually I am saving money to buy at least this video, because here we have currency in rupees and conversion to dollar is bit heavy on pocket. No doubt I am earning fair enough as software engineer but still amount is a more in terms of rupees.</p>

<p>These are not the only thing, I am currently checking out few more screen casts. And they are awesome. I always in favor of knowledge sharing. And may be this is the only reason to have a dream to work in Microsoft. Money obviously matters, but that I can earn it any how. At the end of the day I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat">Gujarat</a> . But knowledge, learning new things and specially having fun at what I do; will be possible at few places only. It is not about Microsoft but about persons like <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> , <a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil Haack</a> , <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and others. Working with them is seriously a fun stuff, its like you are learning from a university and also getting paid for that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, Scott Sir. In any case you are reading this. Please Please do take care of your self. At least buy me some time so I can meet you in person someday in future. Diabetes called as “Rajarog” in India. Means it only comes to king and/or it is king of all diseases as it provide wonderful platform for other diseases to have dance off. So, please do take care and keep on talking. I never miss your screen cast or talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I seriously like to thank Rob and Team for bringing up such a wonderful world of knowledge. And also having open pass to access them on weekend. Keep on the good work.</p>

<p>I seriously recommended that wasting time for some box office flicks, better enjoy heroes from Technology world.</p>

<p>Thanks of Open House at <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> . And thanks to <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net">pluralsight</a> </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

        <a href="/2012/03/moving-away-from-oop/">Moving away from OOP</a> 
        <span>posted on 24 Mar 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>OOP, it is a full form of Object Oriented Programming. And even with starting of career in software engineering we are force to implement OOP in our coding. Cross your heart and tell how many time we are implementing???</p>

<p>I start my career with .Net / C#. And C# is object oriented language. But I code like C. Pushing function for every thing. May be it is my love for it. And what happened I end up with 14000 line of code and crashing the system. At that point of time I shift and optimized my code which end up with 700 lines of code and pretty nice working product. This is the first time I come to know that there is a use of object oriented system other than writing exam and cracking interview.</p>

<p>But again its just about creating objects, nothing else. Then I work with pretty big web application. At that point I learn something about Architecture. Oh! that is nice. Even software also has an Architecture. So, it is moving away from OOP. May be yes ???</p>

<p>It is like difference between Civil engineer and an Architecture. It is some advanced functionality which are implemented using Object Oriented fundamentals. And these are not new things but advanced version of what I have learn. These are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Design Patterns</a> .</p>

<p>First it was created by Gang of Four. They are pillars and pioneers of design patterns. Although it is easy to learn but hard to choose between. But may be in future I will be writing something on these patterns. Till than if you are from Dot Net background do check out <a href="http://dofactory.com/Default.aspx">this</a> site. It has all the details needed to learn Design Patterns.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Hope you have read my earlier <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/arrival-of-david-aka-micro-orm">post</a> about Micro <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . Here I talk about another Micro ORM <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . I don’t want to go with traditional approach. I write intro about <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and give some details about <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . Few example here and there, some hyperlinks and that’s it. I will try to find answer of “why” instead of “how”. For how part we have more than enough example and also have <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> to solve issues. Still I go through technical details at the end, but article will not be like tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> .</p>

<p>Let’s start from the start. I was just wondering around the <a href="http://asp.net">asp.net</a> web site. And come across the tutorial of <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/mvc-1/aspnet-mvc-storefront/aspnet-mvc-storefront-part-1-architectural-discussion-and-overview">store front</a> . There I found person with name <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> . As usual I found his site and come to know that he recently left job. I was little upset, as I liked the way he explained. Then I came across his another video in speaking section, <a href="http://ndc2011.macsimum.no/mp4/Day2%20Thursday/Track1%201140-1240.mp4">Kill Your ORM</a> . This is the first time I come across something called Micro ORM. And this is the moment when I press the refresh button of my technical skill or thinking or approach what so ever you can say. I just open up my mind and options I am trying.</p>

<p><a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> is like Tony Stark of Technical Arena. And every now and then he create some new element ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OSS</a> ).</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/robconery/massive" alt="](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Eq-pGJZhHtU/URHJx47Y2dI/AAAAAAAAAsY/LO2BqVFZUTQ/s800/iron-man-32_2.jpg) <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GIE2x98SNDE/URHJqwsNwNI/AAAAAAAAAqM/l7n__dsAo9o/s800/RobCon_Hanselman_2_2.jpg" alt="" /> The second one in white shirt is Rob Sir. He is not just in his Iron suit.

<p>Now, come back to <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why???????</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn’t it nice to have POCO objects and that will take care of all things. Obviously it is NICE. I don’t like Database at all. And that complex joins and yet another language to learn… Nope. I hate it. But just give the answer of one simple question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I am using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> , does it allow me to not to use SQL at all? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I don’t think so. And I am not talking about hypothetical situation. I am talking about real life situation. Real project and real experience. Every now and then I have to double check my query with SQL query. This just double the work of mine. And it is useful to add value to my Resume only. Here I am not talking about performance at all. Everyone knows benchmark. I am talking about working. In a very distributed system, with DBA working round the clock.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a space for ORM?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don’t think so. If I am alone and working on some small scale project than its fine. Just go with it. But with big scale project even today also DBAs are integral part of system. And trust me they don’t know .net or Java or not even care about it. I have use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IOC</a> , <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository Pattern</a> , <a href="http://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html">Factory Pattern</a> or anything else they don’t even care. They just create that massy tables which no one going to understand in one shot. At least I never understand that one to one and one to many and n level down with tables relationship at one shot. I remember eventually but still at one shot no chance.</p>

<p>Many will argue that, ORM will decrease my work on application level. Yes may be. But thing is I am learning something to replace something. Like I am learning Entity Framework because I don’t like to work with SQL. I learn every in and out of Entity Framework, checking out screen cast, blogs, articles etc. And one day I have to debug query which is SQL. I feel this is just overhead. At least for now. At some point of time, may be there will be no need of Database or SQL. Everything will shift to Application level and at that point of time EF will be necessity or just part of language. But now it is not. And that is creating problems. And it is general statement for all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> s. You are learning something new but old is still there you cant escape. Even <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> has some learning curve. But in case of Micro ORMs learning curve is some what simpler and smaller.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If in any case Rob sir if you are reading this article can you please give the answer of these questions. I should devote more time to execute complex task or why ORM is not working to execute task? Either learn and add html tag or give more time to why html helper is not working?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Means there are more important things to do, other than solving error of framework which are designed to help us. I am not criticizing framework, I just love it and can’t leave with out it but if they are replacing core than good but if I have to use combination than I am not in favor of it. Like C# is developed over C++, but I never have to debug C# at C++ level. I hope you are getting my point. One more example of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockoutjs</a> . It is java script library which is using “data-bind’ key word to bind with java script object or function. Now, I want to use it with html helper. I simply pass anonymous object in it and banged. Error arrived. I Google it, waste almost half an hour and find out I have to pass “data_bind” instead of “data-bind” specifically for helper method. If I am using pure html syntax than my half an hour is saved.</p>

<p>I am not opposing concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> and also if I got chance will work to improve it to next level. But when I have to create application with time constraint I will avoid it. This is complete personal opinion. But I do have some reason to support my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, How?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As promise this will be short and sweet. I personally go for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVVM">MVVM pattern</a> . Now, if I am developing application using Asp.Net MVC. I have controller, model and view. Now, in model section I separated with two section. ViewModel and Model. I do it by using two different files. You can chose any other approach. In model we have class which have one to one relationship with database and inherited from DynamicModel from <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . And view model has class which can be used in views and same type of class we can have in java script. So, it can be used using <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockoutjs</a> . Here are some example of <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . This is directly taken from site. If anyone want can skip it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is another best part of Micro ORM. You don’t need tutorial at all. I am not good at SQL, <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> can execute any complex SQL using same syntax, <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> it self is quite simple. So, I don’t have anything special or complex or alien to write.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>public class Products:DynamicModel { //you don't have to specify the connection - Massive will use the first one it finds in your config 
</code></pre>

<p>public Products(): base ( "northwind" , "products" , "productid" ) {
    } 
  } 
  var table = new Products(); //grab all the products 
  var products = table.All(); //just grab from category 4. This uses named parameters 
  var productsFour = table.All(columns: "ProductName as Name" , where : "WHERE categoryID=@0" ,args: 4); 
  var result = tbl.Query( "SELECT * FROM Categories" ); // my favorite function, no need to learn massive use this function :P 
    for Grid view like things, it also has paged query. 
  var result = tbl.Paged(where : "UnitPrice &gt; 20" , currentPage:2, pageSize: 20); // Insert and update are quite flexible in Massive, you should try with different options 
  var table = new Products(); 
  var poopy = new {ProductName = "Chicken Fingers" }; //update Product with ProductID = 12 to have a ProductName of "Chicken Fingers" 
  table.Update(poopy, 12); 
  var table = new Products(); //update Product with ProductID = 12 to have a ProductName of whatever was submitted via the form 
  table.Update(poopy, Request.Form); //pretend we have a class like Products but it's called Categories 
  var table = new Categories(); //do it up - the new ID will be returned from the query 
  var newID = table.Insert(new {CategoryName = "Buck Fify Stuff" , Description = "Things I like" }); </p>

<p>So, Here is the reason why I prefer Micro ORM or NO ORM over ORM. I learned, I used and I am hurt so I avoid. But trust me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> is so cool to mess with it but it should be done in free time for personal learning at least for now. Still there can be few more things to discuss, but I like to do that in comment section specially for this article.</p>

<p>Comments are always welcome!!!</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>If you have read my previous <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/going-to-vietnam-because-of-orm">post</a> . I have talk about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> can create mess with the application. And prior to <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/map-lsquo-your-self-rsquo-using-orm">that</a> I have write that it speed up the production like anything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, Am I contradicting my self ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I am just learning new things. I am using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> but now I am more careful while using it. That’s it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, why Vietnam ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My post is originally inspired by Ted Neward’s <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The%2BVietnam%2BOf%2BComputer%2BScience.aspx">blog</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . And after effect of that blog in the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science.html">blog</a> of Jeff Atwood.&nbsp; This two blogs nailed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> like anything. So, now we have two things ORM is good to increase productivity but bad when it comes to performance. And this gives the birth to Micro ORM.</p>

<p><img src="http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6734/kgbr.jpg" alt="" /> </p>

<p>As, I remember one of the first Micro ORM is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/">Dapper</a> from the team of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> . And parallel we have <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> from <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> . <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/">Dapper</a> comes because traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> burned the server of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> by continuously using 100% of CPU. This happens because of heavy access and complex queries generated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . As per them after that; they&nbsp; rewrite the database access of application, remove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> and use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/">Dapper</a> . And then after they open source it. And this is the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> which has better performance just after direct data access to data base. And <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> , it just developed because <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> is one of kind of genius person who just like want one more open source project under his belt.</p>

<p>There are few others</p>

<p>Obviously Dapper is fastest as per the benchmark available over their site. But I like <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> the most. And other than that <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> is also quite good. I first like to talk about <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> and will talk about <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> in my next post.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> is a wrapper around System.Data namespace.And may be this is the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> with table creation support. So, it do support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET_Entity_Framework#Code_First">code first</a> development. It do give me feeling of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> without losing performance. So, now we dig into <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> .</p>

<p>If you have worked with classic data access you must have remember data connection class and data command class. Then there is a string variable for Query and data command has that command text and command type. In that we pass details as parameter to save our self from SQL injection. Good old days. I don’t like this type of fuss that much, and every now and then check over then connection. Writing query in database and then again in code.</p>

<p>This is the ORM which solves most of the problem.&nbsp; Here, I will explain how ??? I am using most of the example from its site only. So, if you like to skip the topic here. You can, but I think if you like the above part you will like the rest too. By the way here is the link of <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> .</p>

<p>First and best thing of <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> is, it creates table. Though it provide only one to one mapping with database but still it <strong>CAN</strong> creates the <strong>TABLES.</strong> I am not just big fan of creating table with query. And after writing things on paper, you find very rare occasion where you need to write query for creating table. And also I am more of C# guy, even when I have started the journey of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> , with LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework, I go with reverse mapping. But after that <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework">Entity Framework Code First</a> enters. That is awesome for creating tables for you. So, you can concentrate on core logic. But again it is Entity Framework so !!!</p>

<p>Here, is the sample of it. You can start with making POCO classes without worrying about your database.</p>

<p>public enum PhoneType {
    Home,
    Work,
    Mobile,
  }
  public enum AddressType {
    Home,
    Work,
    Other,
  }
  public class Address {
  public string Line1 { get; set; }
  public string Line2 { get; set; }
  public string ZipCode { get; set; }
  public string State { get; set; }
  public string City { get; set; }
  public string Country { get; set; }
  }
  public class Customer {
    public Customer() {
      this.PhoneNumbers = new Dictionary <PhoneType, string>();
      this.Addresses = new Dictionary <AddressType, Address>();
    }</p>

<pre><code>[AutoIncrement] 
public int Id { get; set; }

public string FirstName { get; set; }
public string LastName { get; set; }

[Index(Unique = true)] 
public string Email { get; set; }

public Dictionary &lt;PhoneType, string&gt; PhoneNumbers { get; set; }  
public Dictionary &lt;AddressType, Address&gt; Addresses { get; set; }  
public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>}  </p>

<p>Again this supports all the data annotation from .net 4.0. Here is the example of it.</p>

<pre><code>public class Order {

[AutoIncrement]
public int Id { get; set; }

[References(typeof(Customer))]  
public int CustomerId { get; set; }

[References(typeof(Employee))]  
public int EmployeeId { get; set; }

[StringLenght(256)]
public string ShippingAddress { get; set; } 

public DateTime? OrderDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? RequiredDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? ShippedDate { get; set; }
public int? ShipVia { get; set; }
public decimal Freight { get; set; }
public decimal Total { get; set; }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>So, it supports required, Max Length and all others. I haven’t check all though.</p>

<p>Now, the CRUD operation. It is easy like anything.</p>

<pre><code>var dbFactory = new OrmLiteConnectionFactory(@"Data Source=.SQLEXPRESS;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|App_DataDatabase1.mdf;Integrated Security=True;User Instance=True",SqlServerOrmLiteDialectProvider.Instance);  
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the catch. I was unable to find property to set Dialect provider. After initiating default blank constructor. But you can always go with this default example. Then, one just need to remember that old days of connection creation and command creation and just fire up the command. But, this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . Things must be easy here. And yes, it is damn easy.</p>

<p>I have never seen this much classic use of extension method before. <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a> extend the functionality of default class and make our work easy like anything. Here, is the example</p>

<p>```cs    </p>

<pre><code>//Non-intrusive: All extension methods hang off System.Data.* interfaces
IDbConnection dbConn = dbFactory.OpenDbConnection()
IDbCommand dbCmd = dbConn.CreateCommand()

//Re-Create all table schemas:
dbCmd.DropTable &lt;OrderDetail&gt;()
dbCmd.DropTable &lt;Order&gt;()
dbCmd.DropTable &lt;Customer&gt;()
dbCmd.DropTable &lt;Product&gt;()
dbCmd.DropTable &lt;Employee&gt;()

dbCmd.CreateTable &lt;Employee&gt;()
dbCmd.CreateTable &lt;Product&gt;()
dbCmd.CreateTable &lt;Customer&gt;()
dbCmd.CreateTable &lt;Order&gt;()
dbCmd.CreateTable &lt;OrderDetail&gt;()

dbCmd.Insert(new Employee { Id = 1, Name = "Employee 1" })
dbCmd.Insert(new Employee { Id = 2, Name = "Employee 2" })
var product1 = new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Product 1", UnitPrice = 10 }
var product2 = new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Product 2", UnitPrice = 20 }
dbCmd.Save(product1, product2)

var customer = new Customer
{
  FirstName = "Orm",
  LastName = "Lite",
  Email = "ormlite@servicestack.net",
  PhoneNumbers =
  {
    { PhoneType.Home, "555-1234" },
    { PhoneType.Work, "1-800-1234" },
    { PhoneType.Mobile, "818-123-4567" },
  },
  Addresses =
  {
    { AddressType.Work, 
    new Address 
      { Line1 = "1 Street", Country = "US", State = "NY", City = "New York", ZipCode = "10101" } 
      },
    },
    CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
  }
dbCmd.Insert(customer)

var customerId = dbCmd.GetLastInsertId()
customer = dbCmd.QuerySingle &amp;lt;Customer&amp;gt;(new { customer.Email })
Assert.That(customer.Id, Is.EqualTo(customerId))

//Direct access to System.Data.Transactions:
using (var trans = dbCmd.BeginTransaction(IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted))
{
  var order = new Order
{
CustomerId = customer.Id,
EmployeeId = 1,
OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow,
Freight = 10.50m,
ShippingAddress = new Address { Line1 = "3 Street", Country = "US", State = "NY", City = "New York", ZipCode = "12121" },
}
dbCmd.Save(order)

order.Id = (int)dbCmd.GetLastInsertId()

var orderDetails = new[] {
  new OrderDetail
  {
    OrderId = order.Id,
    ProductId = product1.Id,
    Quantity = 2,
    UnitPrice = product1.UnitPrice,
  },
  new OrderDetail
  {
    OrderId = order.Id,
    ProductId = product2.Id,
    Quantity = 2,
    UnitPrice = product2.UnitPrice,
    Discount = .15m,
  }
}

dbCmd.Insert(orderDetails)

order.Total = orderDetails.Sum(x =&gt; x.UnitPrice * x.Quantity * x.Discount) +  order.Freight

dbCmd.Save(order)

trans.Commit()
}  
</code></pre>

<p>```<br />
So, As you can see. It supports mighty POCO and handles almost everything. If you have a question, this can be done by Entity Framework too. And even in pretty nicer way. Then here is the answer, <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/benchmarks/">benchmark</a> . Speed, performance, scalability it is the thing which makes the difference.</p>

<p>Now, anyone can write a code. I definitely don’t mind that. But there are few who really write good code. And please I am not saying about following standards of casing but saying about trimming things up, take bold decision and follow rules of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Flower</a> .</p>
