First enemy I found was you<br />
First fight I had was with you<br />
First person I always miss is you<br />
I miss you, my dear sister</p>

<p>Beating me was your favorite game<br />
Teasing me with different names<br />
Remaining is now, only the pain<br />
Not being with you, I feel mundane<br />
I miss you, my dear sister

      <p>I am in Bangalore, and first thing I found here classically well is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a>. Obviously I will not going to talk about coffee here. But about <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> which is as good as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a> . I come to know about <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> from the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CoffeeScriptSassAndLESSSupportForVisualStudioAndASPNETWithTheMindscapeWebWorkbench.aspx">article</a> written by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> . And I become addicted to it. I am not much a web guy. I like coding but mostly on server end. And Visual Studio is always there to save me. But when it comes to Java Script, I just crash land any time. I always try to go back to server as soon as possible. Obviously <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> is there to bail me out. But still it is only for DOM, but for other things, you have to be expert. Now, here expert means whose written <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> pass the <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> with minimum errors. Simple functions and doing some addition is not a big deal but making a library for web application is do a big deal. At least for me. I am so rigid about my code quality and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> is a damn flexible scripting language which easy become a sloppy for me. I always try to follow architecture define by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">Java Script Good Parts</a> . But at the end following some rules in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C Sharp</a> is easy than follow in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a>. But God is with me. I found a friend who is damn powerful in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> .

      <p>I am not much a writer kind of person. If you drop a math puzzle, probably I will do it in better way. But sometimes it is necessity to do thing even though you are not good at it. Just like this Open Letter. <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> is wonderful endeavor from <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and one of his friend <a href="http://averyblog.com/">James Avery</a> . I know <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> because of <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> .</p>

<p>You can consider me in his fan club, if he is having one. I don’t know of it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, Rob. Do you have any fan club like thing ??? I really like to join one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here in India, every other teacher expect student to be like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna">Arjuna</a> , because of his concentration and dedication towards the learning or work. But the person they forget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a> . And Rob sir is providing that opportunity to world to learn like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a> . Learning from distance and prove your worthy.</p>

<p><a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> is having open house for a weekend. And first thing I have done is watching a video of a programming wizard, genius developer and classic speaker <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> . I was waiting for this from a long time. Actually I am saving money to buy at least this video, because here we have currency in rupees and conversion to dollar is bit heavy on pocket. No doubt I am earning fair enough as software engineer but still amount is a more in terms of rupees.

      <p>OOP, it is a full form of Object Oriented Programming. And even with starting of career in software engineering we are force to implement OOP in our coding. Cross your heart and tell how many time we are implementing???</p>

<p>I start my career with .Net / C#. And C# is object oriented language. But I code like C. Pushing function for every thing. May be it is my love for it. And what happened I end up with 14000 line of code and crashing the system. At that point of time I shift and optimized my code which end up with 700 lines of code and pretty nice working product. This is the first time I come to know that there is a use of object oriented system other than writing exam and cracking interview.</p>

<p>But again its just about creating objects, nothing else. Then I work with pretty big web application. At that point I learn something about Architecture. Oh! that is nice. Even software also has an Architecture. So, it is moving away from OOP. May be yes ???

      <p>Hope you have read my earlier <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/arrival-of-david-aka-micro-orm">post</a> about Micro <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . Here I talk about another Micro ORM <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . I don’t want to go with traditional approach. I write intro about <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and give some details about <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . Few example here and there, some hyperlinks and that’s it. I will try to find answer of “why” instead of “how”. For how part we have more than enough example and also have <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> to solve issues. Still I go through technical details at the end, but article will not be like tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> .</p>

<p>Let’s start from the start. I was just wondering around the <a href="http://asp.net">asp.net</a> web site. And come across the tutorial of <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/mvc-1/aspnet-mvc-storefront/aspnet-mvc-storefront-part-1-architectural-discussion-and-overview">store front</a> . There I found person with name <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> . As usual I found his site and come to know that he recently left job. I was little upset, as I liked the way he explained. Then I came across his another video in speaking section, <a href="http://ndc2011.macsimum.no/mp4/Day2%20Thursday/Track1%201140-1240.mp4">Kill Your ORM</a> . This is the first time I come across something called Micro ORM. And this is the moment when I press the refresh button of my technical skill or thinking or approach what so ever you can say. I just open up my mind and options I am trying.

      <p>If you have read my previous <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/going-to-vietnam-because-of-orm">post</a> . I have talk about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> can create mess with the application. And prior to <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/map-lsquo-your-self-rsquo-using-orm">that</a> I have write that it speed up the production like anything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, Am I contradicting my self ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I am just learning new things. I am using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> but now I am more careful while using it. That’s it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, why Vietnam ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My post is originally inspired by Ted Neward’s <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The%2BVietnam%2BOf%2BComputer%2BScience.aspx">blog</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . And after effect of that blog in the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science.html">blog</a> of Jeff Atwood.&nbsp; This two blogs nailed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> like anything. So, now we have two things ORM is good to increase productivity but bad when it comes to performance. And this gives the birth to Micro ORM.

      <p>In my previous <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/map-lsquo-your-self-rsquo-using-orm">post</a> I have talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . But believe if you don’t use thing wisely you are going to fall like anything. In this article I am not going to write any code but still it is a pure technical article. I will talk about enterprise application and how quickly love for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> will drag you to the black hole.</p>

<p>Around two years back, at the time when .Net 3.5 arrived, I was reading a chapter from a book. It is from <a href="http://oreilly.com/">Oreilly</a> in that author states that your DBA’s job is in danger we have LINQ to SQL a easy way to do the task. And trust me I just like this statement. I am not DB guy, and don’t like much to mess with database. But as I learn more, I understand the importance of Database guys and database. And personally I found person like <a href="http://beyondrelational.com/blogs/chintak/">Chintak Chappia</a> who is not only good with database but also as friend, philosopher and guide. I definitely don’t want to piss him off by my simple LINQ queries which eventually generates complex SQL queries. Don’t trust me here is the <a href="http://datachomp.com/archives/getting-started-with-massive-in-mvc3/">example</a> .</p>

<p>Now, take a hypothetical example very big application. Now, this application has around 1000+ tables and 35+ modules to handle. Ya, very big application it is. And first and foremost mistake done by programmer is to add edmx file for all database. (Here I am taking example of EF only, but this is true for all other ORMs too. )

      <p>Many of you must know this word, “ORM”. Then why this post. But trust, even after we have a lots and lots of ORMs in market and some company still using age old technology. Just few days back in one company again I had to face same old question about connection class and command class. Why?????????? It is so true that one must know that things, but this question is always be a nightmare to me.</p>

<p>When I have a java advanced as a subject, I use to do all things other than JDBC connection. I had never completed a single database connection using JDBC. And may be that is the reason why I haven’t choose career with Java. I am not Ninja anymore. It is my unfulfilled dream!!!</p>

<p>Let’s come back to .net. We used to have connection and command class rule the arena in .net. Every interview starts with that and blast because of that. Question starts with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is connection class? And what are the uses of it?</p>
  
  <p>What is command class?</p>
  
  <p>Difference between data set and data reader?

      <p>OSS, stands for Open Source Software. If you are a .net developer, most of the time you don’t care much of OSS. But trust me, OSS are far better than pure solution provided by MS.</p>

<p>And now MS is pushing for OSS, via <a href="http://nuget.org">nuget</a> . It’s a wonderful site providing base for OSS technologies. If you have experienced development in Ruby, you must have known this. Ruby has gems, which pushed by open source community. And now .net developer has <a href="http://nuget.org">nuget</a> .</p>

<p>Its so difficult to follow day to day open source work. Trust I don’t know much more than JQuery. But now I am just a click away of whole new world of Open Source Framework and Technology.
