      </h1> 
      
      <p>I am particularly a lazy guy. I don’t work hard, stay back and never show sad face to issue or bug. Obviously many don’t like me for this. But again “who cares?”. But one thing is sure for me, I always ready to learn new things and obviously always work for better code. At the end of day it is just a code, bugs will be there and me too , to solve the issue.</p>

<p>Here, I mentions new things, but in reality it is not possible all the time that I will get new things. Some time I will get old things to take care off. Or something that never changed. I was reading old articles from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Hanselman</a> , now a days he is putting more preference over high quality article. So, his articles are not coming daily basis. So, one day I was wondering towards the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GreatestHits.aspx">hit series of articles</a> and I found “ <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SomeGuidingPrinciplesForSoftwareDevelopment.aspx">some guiding principles for software development</a> ”. And again as per suggestion again from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Hanselman</a> I <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/InstapaperDeliveredToYourKindleChangesHowYouConsumeWebContentPlusIFTTTBlogsAndMore.aspx">read later</a> it.</p>

<p>Now, I was working on something and just to get refreshed I was checking my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> and found this one. I was reading it. First thing I noticed is that it was written in 2007; even before I was a certified software engineer. As, I normally don’t read historical article that much but I read this. And that surprised me!!! Nothing is changed at all. Principles are same even after 5 years of this articles. And when they written it was there only. And also one thing is not changed too, we are not following most of them… (saying from the personal experience). For a change now a days I tried to follow them…</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Oops, I used “Duffer” instead of “Dummy” because I am one of it.</p>

<p>I installed OS nearly 8 times to get what I wanted from Windows 8. I brought new Dell Ultra book and first thing I have done is to install consumer preview, second thing installing VS2012. And I meet my first issue, it is not allowed so I need to use trial version, so another format and new OS in.</p>

<p>Here, I have made another mistake to install it in SSD, I thought I put OS there and all other things in other drive. As, at that point of time I really don’t know why on the earth that 32 GB SSD is there. It is fast but what I do with that. As, it was not showing at the time, when default Windows 7 was there. OK, it goes as per plan and my system things got better and better but my drive got screwed big time. Always I need to watch that is it full or not.</p>

<p>Than I got mail that Pro version is available. Wow, I just loved that news. So, first thing first learn about SSD and I got wonderful <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1227655/how-to-set-up-intel-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching">article</a> written by Sean. Ok, now I know that SSD for caching only. Here, issue again that I need to order first as direct download of ISO is not available. Damn is seriously don’t like this.</p>

<p>To, do that I need to reinstall Windows 7 and then I started the process using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/upgrade-offer">upgrade wizard</a> . I ordered my brand new Windows 8 Pro and started downloading. Then there is wizard come that give me option to create a ISO for that. I selected that. And then I have created my boot USB.

        <span>posted on 08 Oct 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Whenever something came from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> employee there is always a buzz… And I still don’t understand why person’s company policies do with person’s attitude or approach of a person. Same happens when <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> came. It was just a day old and Open Source People starts bashing it like anything. Comparing with <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> , <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> . Guys, it is also open source and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> in any case not forcing anything. As of now. If you like use it if you don’t just don’t use it. </p>

<p>In any case it is just a <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . There is very positive buzz when <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> came. But for <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> was not that fortunate.</p>

<p>It is normal. Even I thought just another things come from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> that is similar to <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . But I was wrong it is far different than <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . I am in long time relationship with typed language like C-*, JAVA and recently fall in love with Ruby like language. So, I kinda like both. I don’t have problem with any. Whenever I am learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I like to code with <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and even I started using with my day to day work in .Net. But there is no symmetry in that. I am missing that. And typescript came to solve that issue. Obviously some people claim that they don’t need good tool but still I wonder how can a person make enterprise level language using notepad.</p>

        <span>posted on 17 Sep 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>In my previous <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/java-script-diary-1">post</a> I have written about some <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> basics from the point of view of Software Engineering and Architecture. In this post I will stay close to metal. I will talk about few things we should care about <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> language. Things that’s should be or shouldn’t be in the code.</p>

<p>I am from hard core compile language background. My first company is Game Company where I have built kind of Game Engine and second company I work on C++. Even in third company I was working on web project but most of the time I stay on the server end. So, I have support of managed nature of C Sharp. But in case of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> it is not true. And many time people makes mistakes what I did. Take <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> as compiled language and work like that only. Obviously its like other programming languages only, its all about if and else but its little bit different. My this post is going to be completed by the video of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> . Here I am attaching video, too. Please go through the video and checkout what should be taken care while writing <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . Its 50 minutes long and obviously worth spending 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Here is the video.</p>

      <p>Long back I have wrote a article on <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . If anyone see closely its all about writing proper Java Script in easy way. But in many cases its not possible that you got chance to write <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . Or if you are learning some library like <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> , also if you are using some framework like <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> . Than using <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and also using this function to learn than it will be difficult to catch up together. If you are not powerful enough with one of either.</p>

<p>And as a base rule. Even you are using <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> , you are not escaping from <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . It was there and it will be there for future for sure. So, It is worth learning it. If you have read previous article you must know that I am not that good with <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . So, I started learning and also thought for note I should put that to a blog. Whatever I learn will document on my blog. So, that will helpful to others and specially for me.</p>

<p>Most of the guys must be knowing many things. But that’s fine, its again for personal reference.

      <p>I am in Bangalore, and first thing I found here classically well is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a>. Obviously I will not going to talk about coffee here. But about <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> which is as good as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a> . I come to know about <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> from the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CoffeeScriptSassAndLESSSupportForVisualStudioAndASPNETWithTheMindscapeWebWorkbench.aspx">article</a> written by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> . And I become addicted to it. I am not much a web guy. I like coding but mostly on server end. And Visual Studio is always there to save me. But when it comes to Java Script, I just crash land any time. I always try to go back to server as soon as possible. Obviously <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> is there to bail me out. But still it is only for DOM, but for other things, you have to be expert. Now, here expert means whose written <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> pass the <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> with minimum errors. Simple functions and doing some addition is not a big deal but making a library for web application is do a big deal. At least for me. I am so rigid about my code quality and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> is a damn flexible scripting language which easy become a sloppy for me. I always try to follow architecture define by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">Java Script Good Parts</a> . But at the end following some rules in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C Sharp</a> is easy than follow in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a>. But God is with me. I found a friend who is damn powerful in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Java Script</a> .

      <p>I am not much a writer kind of person. If you drop a math puzzle, probably I will do it in better way. But sometimes it is necessity to do thing even though you are not good at it. Just like this Open Letter. <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> is wonderful endeavor from <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and one of his friend <a href="http://averyblog.com/">James Avery</a> . I know <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> because of <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> .</p>

<p>You can consider me in his fan club, if he is having one. I don’t know of it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, Rob. Do you have any fan club like thing ??? I really like to join one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here in India, every other teacher expect student to be like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna">Arjuna</a> , because of his concentration and dedication towards the learning or work. But the person they forget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a> . And Rob sir is providing that opportunity to world to learn like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a> . Learning from distance and prove your worthy.</p>

<p><a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> is having open house for a weekend. And first thing I have done is watching a video of a programming wizard, genius developer and classic speaker <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> . I was waiting for this from a long time. Actually I am saving money to buy at least this video, because here we have currency in rupees and conversion to dollar is bit heavy on pocket. No doubt I am earning fair enough as software engineer but still amount is a more in terms of rupees.

      <p>OOP, it is a full form of Object Oriented Programming. And even with starting of career in software engineering we are force to implement OOP in our coding. Cross your heart and tell how many time we are implementing???</p>

<p>I start my career with .Net / C#. And C# is object oriented language. But I code like C. Pushing function for every thing. May be it is my love for it. And what happened I end up with 14000 line of code and crashing the system. At that point of time I shift and optimized my code which end up with 700 lines of code and pretty nice working product. This is the first time I come to know that there is a use of object oriented system other than writing exam and cracking interview.</p>

<p>But again its just about creating objects, nothing else. Then I work with pretty big web application. At that point I learn something about Architecture. Oh! that is nice. Even software also has an Architecture. So, it is moving away from OOP. May be yes ???

      <p>Hope you have read my earlier <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/arrival-of-david-aka-micro-orm">post</a> about Micro <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">ORM</a> . Here I talk about another Micro ORM <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . I don’t want to go with traditional approach. I write intro about <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> and give some details about <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> . Few example here and there, some hyperlinks and that’s it. I will try to find answer of “why” instead of “how”. For how part we have more than enough example and also have <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> to solve issues. Still I go through technical details at the end, but article will not be like tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> .</p>

<p>Let’s start from the start. I was just wondering around the <a href="http://asp.net">asp.net</a> web site. And come across the tutorial of <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/mvc-1/aspnet-mvc-storefront/aspnet-mvc-storefront-part-1-architectural-discussion-and-overview">store front</a> . There I found person with name <a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> . As usual I found his site and come to know that he recently left job. I was little upset, as I liked the way he explained. Then I came across his another video in speaking section, <a href="http://ndc2011.macsimum.no/mp4/Day2%20Thursday/Track1%201140-1240.mp4">Kill Your ORM</a> . This is the first time I come across something called Micro ORM. And this is the moment when I press the refresh button of my technical skill or thinking or approach what so ever you can say. I just open up my mind and options I am trying.
