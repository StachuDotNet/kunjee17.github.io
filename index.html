      <p>Few day's back I wrote a <a href="2014/02/when-servicestack-meet-fsharp-via-sidewaffle/">article</a> about how I created <a href="http://sidewaffle.com/">side waffle</a> templates for <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a>. </p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://blog.danielmohl.com/">Daniel Mohl</a>, merged the pull request. Add the missing bits make it working and it is up on <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/278caff1-917a-4ac1-a552-e5a2ce0f6e1f">visual studio gallery</a>. I seriously like to thank Daniel for this work and support even after his own hectic schedule of day job. And a wonderful members of <a href="http://fsharp.org">F#</a> community.

      <p>I have specific love for <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a> and that is known thing. It is not because it is awesome or the ways it do web service things, no one else is doing. But because of my past with WCF. It is so rocky that I never want to go back.  And more over <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a> doing hell lot of the things under the cover, and that is also without doing any damn thing into <strong>XML</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hell, yes.. No XML... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, I can write on and on for <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a> but for now it is not the topic. Topic is about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx">Shaving the Yak</a>. There are many hatters of Visual Studio and its project file. I also don't mind sometimes joining the league. But for most of the cases it is doing many things, that we need to do otherwise.

      <p>Thanks to <a href="http://blog.danielmohl.com/">Danial Mohl</a> getting started with Asp.net MVC5 is pretty easy. He had put a tremendous effort to make different kind of templates. Even starting from MVC3 till date now. </p>

<p>Old templates are like there are two projects one is C# and one is <a href="http://fsharp.org">F#</a>. C# is having all the <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Java Script</a>, html, css and stuff while F# is having coding part.

      <p>I am doing web development from quite a long time. And now a days I am keep pushing my self to do functional programming. <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learning</a> languages like <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a>. Obviously I try my hand to other functional languages too as per time permits. </p>

<p>As I am .Net developer my primary focused is working with <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a> and I will also start from that only. You can also check out other functional articles of mine to check out what I think about functional programming and why it is necessity now a days.

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Long back I have tried my hand to writing poems. And trust me I am no where near poetic part. I have good grip over language but that is only for my mother tongue. I am quite comfortable with English but still no where near having artistic touch. Or in simple language my database of words is not that strong. But normally I am able to convey my feelings. </p>

<p>I can say, I am pretty lucky in the case of writing poems. Though I have write only few, many of them got good review from whom so ever read it. But that charm doesn't last that much. </p>

<p>I wrote a poem for my <a href="/2012/04/i-miss-you-sister/">sister</a> and it don't get any kind of review. I do got personal message from sister after a long time that "it was sweet". But that all because she is my sister. Personally if I like to give review to my this poem it is not good at all. There are tsunami of feeling I wanted to convert and I just converted drops of it. And at that moment I decided, will never write poem; at least never in public.

      <p>Whenever I talk about Functional Programming people with experience in web make faces. And seriously don't blame them. </p>

<p>Issue is mainly Functional Programming stays in back ground only. If you see any starting example of any functional language is mainly some machine learning example or some complicated algorithm example. And that may effect normal people to getting started with Functional Programming. </p>

<p>But functional programming can do far more than that. And that include simple things too. And I means it can make thing simpler or I can say it can make easy thing simple. </p>

<p>Here, if I say have to put web case here. May be web is right now most appropriate place where functional programming can be used. And reason is damn simple, current web projects are getting bigger and bigger and user base is also getting even larger. Now, to support that hardware is also getting better and better.

      <p>Now a days I am little bit more involved in History lessons. And those also from Computer Science only. Specifically from programming language's perspective.  Why on the earth I am doing this, I guess answer is given by  <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Duglas Cockford</a> over the <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford">Hanselminutes</a>.  And personally I love this part of learning. It is so delightful to know different language and why languages emerge the way it is.</p>

<p>That is one part of story. Now, I was talking with my friend about different ways of rapid game development, as we both like playing and making games. (Nothing reached to the release level yet though :P). It is fun always. Now, he is working with C++ and I am .Net guy until now. Recently I become web guy on paper with Java Script skills again on paper :P. But as I mentioned I have special love for languages.

      <p>I am not kind of Technical person who started hacking / coding in very early age. But I have special love / affection towards numbers. I don't know why but it always fascinate me.</p>

<p>And this was the starting point or I can say reason I started baby steps in functional programming. I like DI, not in term of Dependency Injection but in case of Data Interpretation. Those tabular data and all the graphs and details that data can produce is awesome. It simply blow away my mind. </p>

<p>It is possible to do analysis in almost any language, but as I have heard it will be fairly easy with functional languages. As, I was coming from .Net background (Its just I am / was using as my day job.) I checked out F#.

      <p>Because it is good. It is fun to write code in functional language. It takes away unnecessary complexity from my way. It do as problem needed I don't need to act as computer to give instruction to computer for how to do computing.

      </h1> 
      
      <p>If you ever involved in web development, then you must be knowing the history of it. Once upon a time there is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI_script">CGI</a>. And at that moment there are static html pages. </p>

<p>Only few part of page is dynamic. Then things changed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_server_pages">ASP</a> came. Server access become so normal and easy. But still there is a lot more work to do. And main issue with them is code is not arranged and coding style is not suitable for big projects. </p>

<p>One can create dirty few pages but creating sophisticated big project is almost big no no. Same is true with other part of languages too. Languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">Php</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Server_Pages">JSP</a> etc.</p>

<p>At that moment, something called <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> took birth. It was extracted from <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. And then it took the world like anything. Even today it is so popular. </p>

<p>I am proper Microsoft Developer. And I know Asp.Net MVC(at least my <a href="http://kunjan.in/pages/resume">Resume</a> says so.). I never felt I should learn any other thing than MVC. It is good, better than Web Forms (at least for me). And I know how to do data in and data out.
