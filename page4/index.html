        <span>posted on 27 Aug 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>If you ever involved in web development, then you must be knowing the history of it. Once upon a time there is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI_script">CGI</a>. And at that moment there are static html pages. </p>

<p>Only few part of page is dynamic. Then things changed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_server_pages">ASP</a> came. Server access become so normal and easy. But still there is a lot more work to do. And main issue with them is code is not arranged and coding style is not suitable for big projects. </p>

<p>One can create dirty few pages but creating sophisticated big project is almost big no no. Same is true with other part of languages too. Languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">Php</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Server_Pages">JSP</a> etc.</p>

<p>At that moment, something called <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> took birth. It was extracted from <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. And then it took the world like anything. Even today it is so popular. </p>

<p>I am proper Microsoft Developer. And I know Asp.Net MVC(at least my <a href="http://kunjan.in/pages/resume">Resume</a> says so.). I never felt I should learn any other thing than MVC. It is good, better than Web Forms (at least for me). And I know how to do data in and data out.

      <p>I want confess that, my whole career I was and I am working with Visual Studio. Not a big fan, but it was good or I must say it is good. I don't think any other IDE is doing as much thing as visual studio is doing. </p>

<p>And with few add-ons (even if you exclude <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>) it is like wow. As full time web developer I like the tools, that always there to solve my issue. </p>

<p>But my love for languages like C# is far more than that. Give me my language and I can do wonders. And I also love OSS work and people doing OSS work in .net. One of my favourite project is <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a>.</p>

<p>Now, here is the point, when a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot">Demis</a>, creator of  <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a> made me thinking. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Am I going to far with my affection for tools? Am I doing it <em>wrong</em>? Am I going in <em>wrong</em> direction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://twitter.com/kunjee/status/344894343066296321">twitter conversation</a>. And I agreed if I don' learn new things I am not doing justification to my old tools. How can I say that Visual Studio is good if I haven't tried <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublimetext</a> or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a>.

      <p>It have been long that I was doing active blogging. There are multiple reason for that, and on of them is being a lazy ass. </p>

<p>I changed my blog from <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net">Orchard</a> to <a href="http://docpad.org/">Docpad</a> for almost no reason. I just wanted my few page look different then other pages. And that will little bit more effort if I am going to do it with <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net">Orchard</a>.  So, I check out on net how to do it. I know Rob was using <a href="http://nestacms.com/">Nesta</a> but I am not good with Ruby, at least that much and more over ruby was giving issue on my windows machine. And switching on my VM just to write blog... Naaaahhh!!!!</p>

<p>Then I moved to Docpad. I have to loose some of my comments, which was there as part of Orchard system. But it was fine. Only painful thing is I have to do lot more work to just get it up as I wanted. It was not like set up and go using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials">Windows Essentials' Live Writer</a>. But it is giving me flexibility. </p>

<p>And in other reason, work load at day job. Things are moving faster then I can plan for. I was trying to learn other languages and tools. Moving out of my comfort zone. So, number of posts are less. Sadly!!!</p>

<p>I also changed my job and my city, so that transaction do take time, specially leaving city like Bangalore was a bit of a pain on my side. Now, I am out shock, almost!

      <p>I have recently moved my blog to docpad. Reason, I want to move to heroku and I want static files to be hosted.</p>

<p>I do have checked out project like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">octapress</a>. They are good but ruby was giving me issue on my windows machine with no reason. And in any case I am better with JavaScript then what I can do with ruby. </p>

<p>And also <a href="http://docpad.org/">docpad</a> is having wonderful plugins system and easy to start skeleton. I was able to get up and started in just no time. </p>

<p>I was hosting my blog with <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard</a> a wonderful .net CMS system. But the thing is it very big for my need. And to edit them I have to write lot more code just to move few parts here and there</p>

<p><a href="http://docpad.org/">docpad</a> on other hand make it very easy to move things as at the end it is just a static html files. So, if I like give somewhat different touch to my any specific page I can give them specifically. I don't need to change complete theme for that. Which is there in other kinda blog engines. </p>

        <span>posted on 05 Dec 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>If you have read my previous articles you must be knowing that I don’t like ORMs that much and also I am pretty lazy person. I don’t like to repeat stuff again and again. If I can find the solution than I will automate it or I just change from very root. Same thing is true with Entity Framework. It comes after LINQ to SQL as an improved ORM. And it proved to be lousy. But here is the catch if we are not using it with all its functionality it is lousy.</p>

<p>Now, it provides proper name at entity level and also inheritance like stuff. Its really a cool and neat feature about Entity Framework to abstract away the complexity of database with ‘_’ name. I never understand this type of names and I don’t know if ever I will be understanding this type of name. But if you are just updating from database and using it, than there is no use of EF at all. Or there is no need of EF. If I will become little bit harsh, then I can say <strong>“WE ARE DOING IT WRONG”</strong> .</p>

<p>And after EF evolved to further version it is providing more features, but still we are stick to the feature which is shown in <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> . We must understand here that there is difference between demo and production. In demo we have pizza factory in production we never have at least in most of the cases. So, things are far different in production environment. If we are just deleting and adding entities then obviously again <strong>“WE ARE DOING IT WRONG”</strong> . If any one think who the hell I am to tell that ??? I am just nothing and no one, but I am open minded to ideas and new things. Just think how much more overhead you are having for pushing EF in production. It is there to help you out not to make things worst.

        <span>posted on 02 Nov 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I am particularly a lazy guy. I don’t work hard, stay back and never show sad face to issue or bug. Obviously many don’t like me for this. But again “who cares?”. But one thing is sure for me, I always ready to learn new things and obviously always work for better code. At the end of day it is just a code, bugs will be there and me too , to solve the issue.</p>

<p>Here, I mentions new things, but in reality it is not possible all the time that I will get new things. Some time I will get old things to take care off. Or something that never changed. I was reading old articles from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Hanselman</a> , now a days he is putting more preference over high quality article. So, his articles are not coming daily basis. So, one day I was wondering towards the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GreatestHits.aspx">hit series of articles</a> and I found “ <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SomeGuidingPrinciplesForSoftwareDevelopment.aspx">some guiding principles for software development</a> ”. And again as per suggestion again from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Hanselman</a> I <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/InstapaperDeliveredToYourKindleChangesHowYouConsumeWebContentPlusIFTTTBlogsAndMore.aspx">read later</a> it.</p>

<p>Now, I was working on something and just to get refreshed I was checking my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> and found this one. I was reading it. First thing I noticed is that it was written in 2007; even before I was a certified software engineer. As, I normally don’t read historical article that much but I read this. And that surprised me!!! Nothing is changed at all. Principles are same even after 5 years of this articles. And when they written it was there only. And also one thing is not changed too, we are not following most of them… (saying from the personal experience). For a change now a days I tried to follow them…</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Oops, I used “Duffer” instead of “Dummy” because I am one of it.</p>

<p>I installed OS nearly 8 times to get what I wanted from Windows 8. I brought new Dell Ultra book and first thing I have done is to install consumer preview, second thing installing VS2012. And I meet my first issue, it is not allowed so I need to use trial version, so another format and new OS in.</p>

<p>Here, I have made another mistake to install it in SSD, I thought I put OS there and all other things in other drive. As, at that point of time I really don’t know why on the earth that 32 GB SSD is there. It is fast but what I do with that. As, it was not showing at the time, when default Windows 7 was there. OK, it goes as per plan and my system things got better and better but my drive got screwed big time. Always I need to watch that is it full or not.</p>

<p>Than I got mail that Pro version is available. Wow, I just loved that news. So, first thing first learn about SSD and I got wonderful <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1227655/how-to-set-up-intel-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching">article</a> written by Sean. Ok, now I know that SSD for caching only. Here, issue again that I need to order first as direct download of ISO is not available. Damn is seriously don’t like this.</p>

<p>To, do that I need to reinstall Windows 7 and then I started the process using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/upgrade-offer">upgrade wizard</a> . I ordered my brand new Windows 8 Pro and started downloading. Then there is wizard come that give me option to create a ISO for that. I selected that. And then I have created my boot USB.

      <p>Whenever something came from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> employee there is always a buzz… And I still don’t understand why person’s company policies do with person’s attitude or approach of a person. Same happens when <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> came. It was just a day old and Open Source People starts bashing it like anything. Comparing with <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> , <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> . Guys, it is also open source and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> in any case not forcing anything. As of now. If you like use it if you don’t just don’t use it. </p>

<p>In any case it is just a <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">javascript</a> . There is very positive buzz when <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> came. But for <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">typescript</a> was not that fortunate.</p>

<p>It is normal. Even I thought just another things come from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> that is similar to <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . But I was wrong it is far different than <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> . I am in long time relationship with typed language like C-*, JAVA and recently fall in love with Ruby like language. So, I kinda like both. I don’t have problem with any. Whenever I am learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I like to code with <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/coffee-with-coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and even I started using with my day to day work in .Net. But there is no symmetry in that. I am missing that. And typescript came to solve that issue. Obviously some people claim that they don’t need good tool but still I wonder how can a person make enterprise level language using notepad.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>In my previous <a href="http://kunjan.in/archives/java-script-diary-1">post</a> I have written about some <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> basics from the point of view of Software Engineering and Architecture. In this post I will stay close to metal. I will talk about few things we should care about <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> language. Things that’s should be or shouldn’t be in the code.</p>

<p>I am from hard core compile language background. My first company is Game Company where I have built kind of Game Engine and second company I work on C++. Even in third company I was working on web project but most of the time I stay on the server end. So, I have support of managed nature of C Sharp. But in case of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> it is not true. And many time people makes mistakes what I did. Take <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> as compiled language and work like that only. Obviously its like other programming languages only, its all about if and else but its little bit different. My this post is going to be completed by the video of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> . Here I am attaching video, too. Please go through the video and checkout what should be taken care while writing <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">JavaScript</a> . Its 50 minutes long and obviously worth spending 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Here is the video.</p>
