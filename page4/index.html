        <a href="/2011/12/di-data-interpretation-of-fdi-foreign-direct-investment/">DI of FDI (Foreign direct investment)</a> 
        <span>posted on 04 Dec 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>It has been a week or so, every day news paper and news channel are full with news of <a href="http://bit.ly/s18yeT">FDI in India</a> . Even Facebook is not taking a step back and speak in favor of both side. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment">FDI</a> in retails should be allowed or not.</p>

<p>I am not a politician, so as engineer I will do data analysis of FDI in India. now, for the sake of example we consider that FDI is allowed in retail market (PS : I personally think that it is going to be allowed) . And great retail players welcomed, in India. Just like east India company. Now, dollars come in and they directly go to farmers to take products. Ohk… now here framers get a BIT more price as they skip mediators. Now, they are the immediate victims of FDI.</p>

<p>We have around 125 corers people and also have internal dependencies in chain management system. Now, for the sake of two end users, big brother will element man small chains and put one big heavy chain. Here, we can advocate that even a one big chain need many persons to work properly. So, we can say that it will generate more employment. We WILL discuss this specific topic afterwards, service v/s self employment.</p>

<p>Now, after first victim is down. We have a classis competition of dollars v/s rupees, its just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath">David v/s Goliath</a> .</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UOYX0j4d74Y/URHJr5nw2nI/AAAAAAAAAqg/bmKB4tSWmoY/s144/david-and-goliath-sumo-version_thumb_2456faf3-4b48-4d31-8a4d-440692818ef1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>They come with dollar back up, give best employment. Buy land at high price. Market go boom. And smile on the face of everyone, at least for a while. Yeah, some brokers and <strong>independent</strong> businessmen, who were there in chain will not be happy. But who cares. Even from the era of non-violence and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi">Gandhiji</a> we also learn one more thing to serve others. Specially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom">British Culture</a> and Foreigners. Sorry to some die hard fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi">Gandhiji</a> but its true. He is there in direct or indirect reason of our slavery even after our so called freedom.</p>

<p>Now back to FDI.</p>

<p>We are getting things at low price. But missing one basic element of our shopping. Relationship with our merchant. So, here we are loosing personal guarantee of shop keeper. We have professional warranty of brand but what on grains???!!!! No one is saving seasonal vegetables for you. If you are lucky you get your favorite vegetables or if not you have to go with whatever is left there. But who cares !!! you are getting vegetables at lower prize.</p>

<p>So, As an engineer and a little bit selfish person I should be happy???????</p>

<p>Nope!!!</p>

<p>Why??? Now, consider a case of my favorite fruit Mango. And I love specific type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango">Mango called Kesar</a> ** and that also specifically from <a href="http://meet-kesarmango.blogspot.com/">Talala Gir area</a> . Now, big brother is going to buy bulk from farmers. And going to sell at lower price. I don’t think so. They sell poor and small pieces of Mangos in India and better will go out side to be sold in foreign currency. I don’t think problem in this too, as we also get used to that. Just like we get used to poor quality of every international brand. We are so good and non-violent people at the end. We are from the country of Great Mahatma Gandhiji. (PS: yes, we are from the country of Gandhiji, but still Gujarat is the only dry state ???!!!! why don’t other states are following our great leader ???!!!)</p>

<p>So, now its time for us to suffer. Poor quality food, grains and vegetables. …. No problem at all, most of the metros are not getting good quality food even now.</p>

<p>So, time passes and we survived and life go on. All the small business men are vanished, cleared, wiped out. No competition at all. Now, big brother can increase price. And yet again we don’t mind. Yaar, we are good people na, at the max we will do some rally and that also non-violently. And our minister comment that “ <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_i-m-no-astrologer-can-t-predict-fall-in-prices-says-sharad-pawar_1333724">I am not astrologer, how can I say what will going to happen in future</a> .” And some remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagat_Singh">Bhagat Singh</a> and <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-25/india/30440409_1_anti-graft-protester-sharad-pawar">hit a slap</a> . But that also ended with <strong>BANDH</strong> in oppose of that slap. It is fine we are in India…</p>

<p>Now, only one person is laughing and laughing laud our own the big brother. But still we will going to celebrate, as big brother will be in the list of Forbes richest person, give lecture at IIMs and comment that India is his favorite market. Why not??? he is selling every good product at high rate in foreign country and getting price of garbage in India. Double profit.</p>

<p>Next big step, investment in farming. If everything is his, then why not farms. And government also welcome that, as they bring new technology to India (PS: what the hell, as don’t know anything about farming ???!!!!) . Obviously this will increase more employment , now farmers are employees too. And banned chemicals are welcomed to India, which increase growth for at least two years. So, time for some smiles now. But then farms are gone, quality goods are gone. And we left with dry land.</p>

<p>No problem, we will <strong>Import</strong> . And government will give subsidy in that. So, now India back to square one. Just it were at the time of 1857 (PS: Many so called urban and modern public don’t know this number, please <a href="http://bit.ly/vhOUwG">google</a> it.)</p>

<p>Still we have one smiling face of big brother. And books of him “How to Become a Millionaire” for future management students.</p>

<p>Now, one topic I have left in the starting service v/s self employment. Now, first thing I am doing job and I am not opposing it. But self employment is also just like that. You are employed if you are earning enough as per your requirement and caliber. Serving some big brother will never make you jolly good fellow. In simple situation if some person is earning 3Rs as profit, he will give 1Rs as salary. Now, this 2Rs will made him more rich every time he earns.</p>

<p>If we take retail sector as per example, a person of transport is earning 12,000Rs per month. Now, there are 10 persons for specific city. So, total earning goes to 1,20,000. Now, big brother hire some around 5 persons and give 15,000Rs salary. So, total earning goes to 75,000Rs. Now, salary is higher for whom, those got the job. But for 5 persons, 10 persons loses their job and employment. And there is movement of only 75,000Rs instead of 1,20,000Rs. Now, a person from commerce background can explain the importance of the “movement of money”.</p>

<p>And one more thing is here to consider. If you or me go to some other country and earn some money, first thing we will do is to send money to our country. Same will be done by the big brother. Profit will be sent to his country. In history we were not poor, but now we are still a developing country. Even at this stage can we afford to send profit to some other country ???? I don’t think so. I guess.</p>

<p>At the end still we have some happiness left. Big Brother is smiling and yes we have few more to join party. Our minister, AKA, sultan, Prince of country and his mom… Who are getting money for welcoming big brother and also take a part of profit as tax. And every one knows now in which country our tax is going ???!!!! (PS: As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya">Chankya</a> tax should be taken in a way honey bee take honey from flowers)</p>

<p>I was so proud for my analytical and mathematical skills, but don’t have answer to this. If you have, please share… Do comment.</p>

<p>(PS Are we going to be slaved again??? Is this the time where we should start asking question to us, our belief ??? Is this the time for change from the root, from the start???!!!!)</p>

        <span>posted on 29 Nov 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I had seen one T-shirt where developer and programmer are erased coder is written below it. I just remember that and was thinking, why so.</p>

<p>Answer is just with me. Every time we start work, and first thing we do is to hit Google. Copy and paste code and make things work. Never bother our self why code is working like that only and why I am copying this only. 60 people out of 100 are doing the same. If you are in India, number may increase to very dangerous level. The person who are doing this, are coders. We are all coders. The first and for most target is to complete task, no matter how, but it should be completed as client’s requirement. We break all software engineering rule, all coding standards and with use of 0.01% of our brain we complete the task. Is this means we are not doing hard work? Nope. We are doing hard work, but only hard work. Just like person working in diamond mine. He is with diamond, he is doing hard work but can’t get benefit of it.</p>

<p>What if we like to take a shift. What if we want to call our selves Programmers? I personally prefer some approaches. First and for most thing stop taking help from God Google. Practice on basic languages like C, C++, Perl etc. Avoid using language with heavy library support and classic GUI like C#, Java and please NO VB. I am big fan of Microsoft, currently using Windows Live Writer for writing this blog, using Visual Studio for all my development but still believe if you ever dream of joining Microsoft, don’t use Microsoft tools, at least in learning phase. And still if anyone want to check his/her talent, go for GCC compiler of Linux. (Note : Use of Linux in command mode is mandatory) . May be there will be a question, even though higher level language available why go for basics. Answer is available in question only, for the need of basics. It provide platform to you, to explorer your creativity. Its all about logic, not language. If one can win race with Ambassador, one surely going to win race with Ferrari. Truly speaking C++ still have that power and charm.</p>

<p>What about next step. Becoming Mr.Developer. If one is programmer of at least 3 to 4 years, there will be no need for any special things to become Developer. Its all about feeling code. Feeling software, need of it. Giving the best crafted work. I can’t provide much detail about it as I am still in phase Programmer. But I have seen Developers working, they don’t just write code, but craft code. Taking every possibility in consideration and giving more agile solution. Its all about understanding the terminology of software.</p>

<p>If I compare all these in the context of automobile than coder is just a driver, don’t know anything about car still driving car, programmer is like mechanic who can repair car but can’t create it. While Developer is just like automobile engineer who create cars.</p>

<p>I am running like any thing, because my beautiful, sexy, stunning and gorgeous Car is waiting for me.</p>

        <span>posted on 13 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Web services is not new to computer world, it is in use from long back. But now a day, with electronic revolution we have lot more devices with loaded application. We want everything everywhere. We need access of <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a> from PC, from mobile, from Tablet.</p>

<p>Everyone has more than one email id, and want to be online at once.Chatting with friends on <a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail</a> , <a href="http://hotmail.com/">hotmail</a> , <a href="http://aol.com/">aol</a> , <a href="http://yahoo.com/">yahoo</a> , <a href="http://icq.com/">ICQ</a> , <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">linkedin</a> and many more. And it is on PC, mobile and also on Tablet. We are leaving in the era rich user interface and powerful internet. Here most of the things are on clouds and still we have leverage of our processor to deliver classy graphics and highly complicated features.</p>

<p>Here SOA comes in picture. Now, when we want everything everywhere then we need a common way of communication which can be use everywhere. Web services are light weight process running on http, and can be consumed anywhere. So, we are getting all our application wherever we go.</p>

<p>SOA is software concept which is highly used now a day. There are two main benefits of SOA, one is that is completely differentiate user interface part and business logic part. And other is that its interpretability.</p>

<p>I personally like the first part, as I not designer kind of person. If you have fix requirements of your project. Then developer can concentrate on service development and designer can concentrate on design. Developer don’t has to bother that what is there at UI end, it may be JQuery UI, Silverlight, Android or WPF reach application. And because of this things will get lot easier. Now, developer will create business logic and UI guys from different areas create UI for different platforms and integrate business logic to that.</p>

<p>And now the real charm of the web services, interpretability. I am a .net developer, my friend is Java developer, now I developed logic and he wants to use it. As java and .net are like brothers but still he need to re-code things. Now with web service this problem is solved. I just put my logic in web service and java guys call that web service from java application without any problem. This is true for vice e verse case. So, it’s wonderful thing. Basically I just loved this concept.</p>

<p>Now, in .net framework there is a web service feature, which provides basic functionality, but with arrival of WCF game is changed a lot. WCF is provides seriously wide range of facility to developer to do their task. We will jump deeper into WCF in upcoming articles.</p>

<p>Till then check out some further details for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA</a> .</p>

        <span>posted on 10 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Pointers, heart of C, C++. If you belongs to engineering branch and learned C as subject, then this may be the last chapter of you curriculum. This is the stepping stone of programming career. This is the chapter or I can say love for the pointer will differentiate a passionate coder from normal coder.</p>

<p>Even if you work, higher level languages or going for web, you can’t deny existence of pointer in your life. It’s just you are not touching directly to them, but they are there every time. Now, I directly jump to basic understanding of topic.</p>

<p>If I give a definition than pointer is variable which saves address of another variable. It is useful when you want to share data. Pointer is like light weight variable which saves memory and do normal task for us like anything.</p>

<p>Pointer consumes two bytes of memory to save address. It doesn’t matter which type of pointer you are using. Here we directly jump to the example</p>

<pre><code>int value = 10; // declaring and assigning simple integer variable.

int *prt = &amp;value; // declaring and assigning simple pointer variable

print value; //printing value

print *ptr; // printing pointer value

print prt; // printing pointer
</code></pre>

<p>Result of this comes somewhat like 10, 10, 8000. Here you can easily understand first and second value gives the value of integer, while last is something else. It is address of the integer, place of memory where pointer stored. Here value is called pointee, a variable pointed by pointer.</p>

<p>Here few things you have to care, you can’t assign value directly to the pointer, like *ptr = 10, if value is not assigned, don’t try to fetch value of that pointer, means *ptr is not assigned then it will give exception. Defining pointer and defining pointee is complete different operation and both are necessary.</p>

<p>This is very basic understanding of Pointers. I will try to go somewhat deeper with this in upcoming write-ups. If you want to know something more about pointers, you can always <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3l3xhfs">click here</a> .</p>

        <span>posted on 10 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I was reading article on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203633104576620972142056528.html">Wall Street Journal</a> , about Steve Jobs. It was wonderful article taken by Ralph, at time of starting phase of apple.</p>

<p>It was the time of change, if any one is familiar with the history of&nbsp; computer world, must know the era of changing. When companies like Microsoft and Apple started and change the rule of game. They change the way of thinking that computer should be big and for co-operate work only. Computer should be good at calculation only, that black screen just calculate and give desire output to management. Person of industry wearing suits and showing standers.</p>

<p>Than hippy like guys arrived, who break all the rule, and drive world to new future. Right now I want&nbsp; to talk about <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">Steve Jobs</a> . Who just left us, leaving behind the a legacy of change and revolution.</p>

<p>Every paragraph of article just showing attitude of Steve, never say never attitude, non-compromising mentality. Courage to take risk, and most important confidence in his own self.</p>

<p>This thing is completely opposite to Indian mentality, where we learn to compromise from the starting. Every time we are forced to change our self as per society. Many of us, just do something for the sake of doing. Earning money is important than earning credit. Confidence is just a short term certificate which we get at college as college result.</p>

<p>I am not saying, I am different. But I can say, I am trying to be different. And one of person behind this is <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">Steve Jobs</a> . I know about him from my college days, but start understanding him after college. Whenever I fill down and out I hear him or read him, which always motivates me to move on.</p>

<p>He is the person with still nerve. No matter whatever it takes, he will achieve what he want. I never seen a person like him. He is gem of crown of silicon-valley. Its not only he done for him self but inspire person like Mark who created <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> , bill gates of <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> and others.</p>

<p>Its not he hadn't face downfall, everyone does in lifetime, but how he reacts is the real thing matters. I personally recommended that everyone directly or indirectly related to computer industry must watch movie Pirates of Silicon-Valley and go through the life of him. Also, can found video of him on <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> .</p>

        <span>posted on 08 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Whoever is ever being engaged with computer science field, they have to come across the term data structure. Even a simple user, using <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> , <a href="http://bing.com/">Bing</a> and other search engine, using <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> for social networking, they all touched by basic fundamental of computers, called data structure. Also, every Computer Science branch has this as part of curriculum.</p>

<p>Here is the one of the best book I found for this. Book called <a href="http://www.bpbonline.com/bookdetail.aspx?id=204">Data Structure Through C++</a> , wonderfully written book by Yashvant Kanetkar. This book starts for basic understanding of the subject, necessity of it, and then explains each and every fundamentals of it.</p>

<p>Yasahvant is always a wonderful writer to read. He is one of that very rare Indian writer who meets the international standard of writing book on computer technology. Also, even with this relatively tough topic, he always take care that write-up stays simple and easy to read.</p>

<p>Simply speaking whoever want to start with data structure, must go through this book. Or even for a topic or two this book is great. This book suitable for beginners as well as experts who ever want take reference of topics like Link list, stacks, queues etc.</p>

<p>Winding up here, by saying this is great book to read, if you belong to computer industry you should at least once in life time read this book.</p>
