      <p>When heart beat for you,<br />
When eyes get wet for you,<br />
You were there<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>It’s not that you don’t know<br />
But you always say it’s NO<br />
You know it all<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>Every word sought for you<br />
Every line sings for you<br />
You read it all<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>It’s not that you don’t know<br />
It’s not that you don’t feel<br />
You know it all, you feel it all<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>I smile because of you<br />
I weep just for you<br />
What more can I say, I live just for you<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>Every time I asked you said NO<br />
Every time it’s NO, just NO<br />
For everything I asked you said NO<br />
Every time it’s NO, nothing but NO<br />
But I never understand   </p>

<p>You should ask the moon, he knows it all<br />
You should ask the stars, they know it all<br />
I’m awake all night, in memory of you<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>It’s not that you have no one else<br />
But it is that I don’t want anyone else<br />
But you never understand   </p>

<p>Now the only thing left is<br />
NO, nothing but NO, just a dry NO<br />
Still I am searching for that one YES<br />
But you never understand   </p>

        <span>posted on 13 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Web services is not new to computer world, it is in use from long back. But now a day, with electronic revolution we have lot more devices with loaded application. We want everything everywhere. We need access of <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a> from PC, from mobile, from Tablet.</p>

<p>Everyone has more than one email id, and want to be online at once.Chatting with friends on <a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail</a> , <a href="http://hotmail.com/">hotmail</a> , <a href="http://aol.com/">aol</a> , <a href="http://yahoo.com/">yahoo</a> , <a href="http://icq.com/">ICQ</a> , <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">linkedin</a> and many more. And it is on PC, mobile and also on Tablet. We are leaving in the era rich user interface and powerful internet. Here most of the things are on clouds and still we have leverage of our processor to deliver classy graphics and highly complicated features.</p>

<p>Here SOA comes in picture. Now, when we want everything everywhere then we need a common way of communication which can be use everywhere. Web services are light weight process running on http, and can be consumed anywhere. So, we are getting all our application wherever we go.</p>

<p>SOA is software concept which is highly used now a day. There are two main benefits of SOA, one is that is completely differentiate user interface part and business logic part. And other is that its interpretability.</p>

<p>I personally like the first part, as I not designer kind of person. If you have fix requirements of your project. Then developer can concentrate on service development and designer can concentrate on design. Developer don’t has to bother that what is there at UI end, it may be JQuery UI, Silverlight, Android or WPF reach application. And because of this things will get lot easier. Now, developer will create business logic and UI guys from different areas create UI for different platforms and integrate business logic to that.</p>

<p>And now the real charm of the web services, interpretability. I am a .net developer, my friend is Java developer, now I developed logic and he wants to use it. As java and .net are like brothers but still he need to re-code things. Now with web service this problem is solved. I just put my logic in web service and java guys call that web service from java application without any problem. This is true for vice e verse case. So, it’s wonderful thing. Basically I just loved this concept.</p>

<p>Now, in .net framework there is a web service feature, which provides basic functionality, but with arrival of WCF game is changed a lot. WCF is provides seriously wide range of facility to developer to do their task. We will jump deeper into WCF in upcoming articles.</p>

<p>Till then check out some further details for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA</a> .</p>

        <span>posted on 10 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Pointers, heart of C, C++. If you belongs to engineering branch and learned C as subject, then this may be the last chapter of you curriculum. This is the stepping stone of programming career. This is the chapter or I can say love for the pointer will differentiate a passionate coder from normal coder.</p>

<p>Even if you work, higher level languages or going for web, you can’t deny existence of pointer in your life. It’s just you are not touching directly to them, but they are there every time. Now, I directly jump to basic understanding of topic.</p>

<p>If I give a definition than pointer is variable which saves address of another variable. It is useful when you want to share data. Pointer is like light weight variable which saves memory and do normal task for us like anything.</p>

<p>Pointer consumes two bytes of memory to save address. It doesn’t matter which type of pointer you are using. Here we directly jump to the example</p>

<pre><code>int value = 10; // declaring and assigning simple integer variable.

int *prt = &amp;value; // declaring and assigning simple pointer variable

print value; //printing value

print *ptr; // printing pointer value

print prt; // printing pointer
</code></pre>

<p>Result of this comes somewhat like 10, 10, 8000. Here you can easily understand first and second value gives the value of integer, while last is something else. It is address of the integer, place of memory where pointer stored. Here value is called pointee, a variable pointed by pointer.</p>

<p>Here few things you have to care, you can’t assign value directly to the pointer, like *ptr = 10, if value is not assigned, don’t try to fetch value of that pointer, means *ptr is not assigned then it will give exception. Defining pointer and defining pointee is complete different operation and both are necessary.</p>

<p>This is very basic understanding of Pointers. I will try to go somewhat deeper with this in upcoming write-ups. If you want to know something more about pointers, you can always <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3l3xhfs">click here</a> .</p>

        <a href="/2011/10/snapshot-of-steve-jobs/">Snapshot of Steve Jobs</a> 
        <span>posted on 10 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I was reading article on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203633104576620972142056528.html">Wall Street Journal</a> , about Steve Jobs. It was wonderful article taken by Ralph, at time of starting phase of apple.</p>

<p>It was the time of change, if any one is familiar with the history of&nbsp; computer world, must know the era of changing. When companies like Microsoft and Apple started and change the rule of game. They change the way of thinking that computer should be big and for co-operate work only. Computer should be good at calculation only, that black screen just calculate and give desire output to management. Person of industry wearing suits and showing standers.</p>

<p>Than hippy like guys arrived, who break all the rule, and drive world to new future. Right now I want&nbsp; to talk about <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">Steve Jobs</a> . Who just left us, leaving behind the a legacy of change and revolution.</p>

<p>Every paragraph of article just showing attitude of Steve, never say never attitude, non-compromising mentality. Courage to take risk, and most important confidence in his own self.</p>

<p>This thing is completely opposite to Indian mentality, where we learn to compromise from the starting. Every time we are forced to change our self as per society. Many of us, just do something for the sake of doing. Earning money is important than earning credit. Confidence is just a short term certificate which we get at college as college result.</p>

<p>I am not saying, I am different. But I can say, I am trying to be different. And one of person behind this is <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">Steve Jobs</a> . I know about him from my college days, but start understanding him after college. Whenever I fill down and out I hear him or read him, which always motivates me to move on.</p>

<p>He is the person with still nerve. No matter whatever it takes, he will achieve what he want. I never seen a person like him. He is gem of crown of silicon-valley. Its not only he done for him self but inspire person like Mark who created <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> , bill gates of <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> and others.</p>

<p>Its not he hadn't face downfall, everyone does in lifetime, but how he reacts is the real thing matters. I personally recommended that everyone directly or indirectly related to computer industry must watch movie Pirates of Silicon-Valley and go through the life of him. Also, can found video of him on <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> .</p>

        <span>posted on 08 Oct 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Whoever is ever being engaged with computer science field, they have to come across the term data structure. Even a simple user, using <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> , <a href="http://bing.com/">Bing</a> and other search engine, using <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> for social networking, they all touched by basic fundamental of computers, called data structure. Also, every Computer Science branch has this as part of curriculum.</p>

<p>Here is the one of the best book I found for this. Book called <a href="http://www.bpbonline.com/bookdetail.aspx?id=204">Data Structure Through C++</a> , wonderfully written book by Yashvant Kanetkar. This book starts for basic understanding of the subject, necessity of it, and then explains each and every fundamentals of it.</p>

<p>Yasahvant is always a wonderful writer to read. He is one of that very rare Indian writer who meets the international standard of writing book on computer technology. Also, even with this relatively tough topic, he always take care that write-up stays simple and easy to read.</p>

<p>Simply speaking whoever want to start with data structure, must go through this book. Or even for a topic or two this book is great. This book suitable for beginners as well as experts who ever want take reference of topics like Link list, stacks, queues etc.</p>

<p>Winding up here, by saying this is great book to read, if you belong to computer industry you should at least once in life time read this book.</p>
