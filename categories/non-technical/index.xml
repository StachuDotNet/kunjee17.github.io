      <description>Few words dedicated to people who made me who I am right now, my teachers. I know few of them personally and few others I am yet to meet in person. But they are still there always for me. Guiding me and helping me whenever and wherever I need. Words are not enough to say Thanks but still here with my small try
Here is original Gujarati Version

      <description>I never thought I would make this public. I wrote long back for one of my dear cousin. It was relevant then. But it is more relevant now. One of my best friend, batch mate, college mate, colleague at one point of time, rommie is now moving to another country. With a aim to never looking back for all the good reasons.
Andrew Vyas this is for you. You are one of the friend I never wanted because I knew one day time flew and you or me will move on and that may be good for future but at point it is utterly painful.</description>

      <description>Few days back Scott Hanselman tweeted
Take a moment, right now, and email the organizers of your favorite Open Source project and THANK THEM.
&amp;mdash; Scott Hanselman (@shanselman) April 15, 2014 
And I think, I should do that. But twitter is too short and emails boring even I don&amp;rsquo;t have email ids of few of my favourite Open Source project managers. But I am not shying away from thanking. So, I am writing this entry.</description>

      <title>Should I continue writing more poems?</title>

      <description>Long back I have tried my hand to writing poems. And trust me I am no where near poetic part. I have good grip over language but that is only for my mother tongue. I am quite comfortable with English but still no where near having artistic touch. Or in simple language my database of words is not that strong. But normally I am able to convey my feelings.
I can say, I am pretty lucky in the case of writing poems.</description>

      <description>It have been long that I was doing active blogging. There are multiple reason for that, and on of them is being a lazy ass.
I changed my blog from Orchard to Docpad for almost no reason. I just wanted my few page look different then other pages. And that will little bit more effort if I am going to do it with Orchard. So, I check out on net how to do it.</description>

      <description>First friend I found was you
First enemy I found was you
First fight I had was with you
First person I always miss is you
I miss you, my dear sister
Beating me was your favorite game
Teasing me with different names
Remaining is now, only the pain
Not being with you, I feel mundane
I miss you, my dear sister
You are Dad’s favorite
You are Mom’s favorite</description>

      <description>It has been a week or so, every day news paper and news channel are full with news of FDI in India . Even Facebook is not taking a step back and speak in favor of both side. FDI in retails should be allowed or not.
I am not a politician, so as engineer I will do data analysis of FDI in India. now, for the sake of example we consider that FDI is allowed in retail market (PS : I personally think that it is going to be allowed) .</description>

      <description>I was reading article on Wall Street Journal , about Steve Jobs. It was wonderful article taken by Ralph, at time of starting phase of apple.
It was the time of change, if any one is familiar with the history of&amp;nbsp; computer world, must know the era of changing. When companies like Microsoft and Apple started and change the rule of game. They change the way of thinking that computer should be big and for co-operate work only.</description>
