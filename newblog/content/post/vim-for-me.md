I want confess that, my whole career I was and I am working with Visual Studio. Not a big fan, but it was good or I must say it is good. I don't think any other IDE is doing as much thing as visual studio is doing. 

And with few add-ons (even if you exclude [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)) it is like wow. As full time web developer I like the tools, that always there to solve my issue. 

But my love for languages like C# is far more than that. Give me my language and I can do wonders. And I also love OSS work and people doing OSS work in .net. One of my favourite project is [Servicestack](http://servicestack.net/).

Now, here is the point, when a conversation with [Demis](https://twitter.com/demisbellot), creator of  [Servicestack](http://servicestack.net/) made me thinking. 

>Am I going to far with my affection for tools? Am I doing it *wrong*? Am I going in *wrong* direction?

Here is the [twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/kunjee/status/344894343066296321). And I agreed if I don' learn new things I am not doing justification to my old tools. How can I say that Visual Studio is good if I haven't tried [Sublimetext](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VIM](http://www.vim.org/).
 
I have tried [Sublimetext](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and pretty much impressed. It is my basic tools to edit web stuff or I am doing something with my blog. It is fast, light weigh with awesome plug ins; almost for every language. 

Now, I am trying for [VIM](http://www.vim.org/), I am starting with [tutorial](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/) suggested by [Amir Rajan](https://twitter.com/amirrajan). 

> Even if there is a slightest chance that your daily work is C# and you are thinking what you are doing with [VIM](http://www.vim.org/); think **again**.

 [Amir Rajan](https://twitter.com/amirrajan) did wonderful [video](http://vimeo.com/72745278), how things work with C#.
 
 Have a look at it

It is like learning new thing. Lets see how far it will go. Will check it out and write about my experience in follow up post.
