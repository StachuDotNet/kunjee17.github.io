      <p>Who ever know something about Indian culture must have know about Gita. As per religion or history whatever you prefer, it is a compilation of words, a message given to Arjuna by Krishna. It is not only for him but for whole world. And trust me this book do have answer of almost any things.</p>

<p>First I brief about this compilation. At the time of Mahabharata war, when Arjuna has to face his own family at war place, kurukshetra. He did not want to fight, he did not want to win at a price of killing his own loved once. At that time Shree Krishna, told him that it is his work, he is not responsible of it. He had to do what is necessary. He didn’t have any right to claim on result of his work. And then whatever communication is done between them is called Bhagwad Gita. Other than Arjuna there were few other who witnesses this communication, one is Ved Vyas who written Mahabharat, one is Sajay a Charioteer of King Dhitrashtra and Hanuman who was there in the flag of Chariot of Arjuna.

        <span>posted on 19 Dec 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Few days back I had written a <a href="http://kunjan.in/index.php/technical/14-net--c-c-sharp/12-ddt-oops-tdd-its-test-driven-development">post</a> , on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development">Test Driven Development</a> . And many of my friends raise question, why should I test and is there anything there in built in Visual Studio. And also more explanation on Test Driven Design. So, Here again I will some what more deeper in testing. Ok, its just a little bit deeper.</p>

<p>First thing, as per title, you should test your self before test your code. It is not philosophical but it is pure technical. If I am writing test for my code, I should know why I am writing? How I am going to write? These few question must be answered before writing test. Now, we are normal kind of coders. I can’t say that whatever code I am writing is going to execute perfectly. In a contrary in most of the cases reverse is true. Every damn time I forgot something to consider and that crash my code. If you are like my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/shahaalap">Aalap</a> then you can go on and on, without writing test. He is damn good with windows technology and write code like anything. And a bit lucky because whenever he writes code, and that piece of shit executes perfectly. But I am not genius like him, so I need to test it.</p>

<p>Again we go with my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Functions">mathematical functions</a> . Because I just loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a> . And this time we are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_">Visual Studio</a> Testing facility. You can go with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunit">NUnit</a> , it almost same, just few syntax changed here and there. But it is not a big deal. Start with new console application. Add new class MathUtil to it. And make is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Class">static class</a> for the simplicity. Now, I am not putting screen shot for “how to use visual studio???”, if you don’t know, this article is not for you better you go and study some basics before jump to this. Sorry…

        <span>posted on 04 Dec 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>It has been a week or so, every day news paper and news channel are full with news of <a href="http://bit.ly/s18yeT">FDI in India</a> . Even Facebook is not taking a step back and speak in favor of both side. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment">FDI</a> in retails should be allowed or not.</p>

<p>I am not a politician, so as engineer I will do data analysis of FDI in India. now, for the sake of example we consider that FDI is allowed in retail market (PS : I personally think that it is going to be allowed) . And great retail players welcomed, in India. Just like east India company. Now, dollars come in and they directly go to farmers to take products. Ohk… now here framers get a BIT more price as they skip mediators. Now, they are the immediate victims of FDI.</p>

<p>We have around 125 corers people and also have internal dependencies in chain management system. Now, for the sake of two end users, big brother will element man small chains and put one big heavy chain. Here, we can advocate that even a one big chain need many persons to work properly. So, we can say that it will generate more employment. We WILL discuss this specific topic afterwards, service v/s self employment.</p>

<p>Now, after first victim is down. We have a classis competition of dollars v/s rupees, its just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath">David v/s Goliath</a> .

      </h1> 
      
      <p>I had seen one T-shirt where developer and programmer are erased coder is written below it. I just remember that and was thinking, why so.</p>

<p>Answer is just with me. Every time we start work, and first thing we do is to hit Google. Copy and paste code and make things work. Never bother our self why code is working like that only and why I am copying this only. 60 people out of 100 are doing the same. If you are in India, number may increase to very dangerous level. The person who are doing this, are coders. We are all coders. The first and for most target is to complete task, no matter how, but it should be completed as client’s requirement. We break all software engineering rule, all coding standards and with use of 0.01% of our brain we complete the task. Is this means we are not doing hard work? Nope. We are doing hard work, but only hard work. Just like person working in diamond mine. He is with diamond, he is doing hard work but can’t get benefit of it.

      <p>Web services is not new to computer world, it is in use from long back. But now a day, with electronic revolution we have lot more devices with loaded application. We want everything everywhere. We need access of <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a> from PC, from mobile, from Tablet.</p>

<p>Everyone has more than one email id, and want to be online at once.Chatting with friends on <a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail</a> , <a href="http://hotmail.com/">hotmail</a> , <a href="http://aol.com/">aol</a> , <a href="http://yahoo.com/">yahoo</a> , <a href="http://icq.com/">ICQ</a> , <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">linkedin</a> and many more. And it is on PC, mobile and also on Tablet. We are leaving in the era rich user interface and powerful internet. Here most of the things are on clouds and still we have leverage of our processor to deliver classy graphics and highly complicated features.</p>

<p>Here SOA comes in picture. Now, when we want everything everywhere then we need a common way of communication which can be use everywhere. Web services are light weight process running on http, and can be consumed anywhere. So, we are getting all our application wherever we go.

      <p>Pointers, heart of C, C++. If you belongs to engineering branch and learned C as subject, then this may be the last chapter of you curriculum. This is the stepping stone of programming career. This is the chapter or I can say love for the pointer will differentiate a passionate coder from normal coder.</p>

<p>Even if you work, higher level languages or going for web, you can’t deny existence of pointer in your life. It’s just you are not touching directly to them, but they are there every time. Now, I directly jump to basic understanding of topic.</p>

<p>If I give a definition than pointer is variable which saves address of another variable. It is useful when you want to share data. Pointer is like light weight variable which saves memory and do normal task for us like anything.

<p>It was the time of change, if any one is familiar with the history of&nbsp; computer world, must know the era of changing. When companies like Microsoft and Apple started and change the rule of game. They change the way of thinking that computer should be big and for co-operate work only. Computer should be good at calculation only, that black screen just calculate and give desire output to management. Person of industry wearing suits and showing standers.</p>

<p>Than hippy like guys arrived, who break all the rule, and drive world to new future. Right now I want&nbsp; to talk about <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">Steve Jobs</a> . Who just left us, leaving behind the a legacy of change and revolution.

      <p>Whoever is ever being engaged with computer science field, they have to come across the term data structure. Even a simple user, using <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> , <a href="http://bing.com/">Bing</a> and other search engine, using <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> for social networking, they all touched by basic fundamental of computers, called data structure. Also, every Computer Science branch has this as part of curriculum.</p>

<p>Here is the one of the best book I found for this. Book called <a href="http://www.bpbonline.com/bookdetail.aspx?id=204">Data Structure Through C++</a> , wonderfully written book by Yashvant Kanetkar. This book starts for basic understanding of the subject, necessity of it, and then explains each and every fundamentals of it.
