Few days back [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) tweeted

And I think, I should do that. But twitter is too short and emails boring even I don't have email ids of few of my favourite Open Source project managers. But I am not shying away from thanking. So, I am writing this entry. 

> Will try to cover every person who made important part in my life mainly professionally and sometimes personally too. But if I miss someone, that will be completely unintentional and I am extremely sorry for that.

Let me tell you a little story. My life was nothing different then every other software engineer who missed first class by .08% and get out of college in the ear of recession. And technically know nothing but little bit of C#.

Things are pretty normal. Just like every other software person in Ahmedabad.

And all dreams and no way to achieve it. Then luckily or unluckily I move to company where I need to work with [Asp.Net MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc). And first thing I did was find something on home site. I don't know there are still any archive available but at that time there is a video series by [Rob Conery](http://www.wekeroad.com/). I didn't even know him by then or even his reputation. For me he is Microsoft employee and I am working in Microsoft Technology so he is God sent. Whatever he say is truth nothing but the truth. 

And while wondering around his site, found the video he gave at [NDC conference](http://www.ndcoslo.com/) called **The Next Big Thing Or Cool-Kid Koolaid? Slicing Through The Rhetoric of MVC vs Web Forms** . Sorry I didn't found any downloadable link for it but I do have a copy of it. This video changed me up side down, changed my way of thinking and learning. I started questioning more and learning more. 

In a way **Rob** is responsible for my way to community. Then I became customer/viewer/admirer of [tekpub](http://tekpub.com/). *Yes, I do earn in rupees and spend in dollars*. but every penny of it is worth it.
