I have recently moved my blog to docpad. Reason, I want to move to heroku and I want static files to be hosted.

I do have checked out project like [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [octapress](http://octopress.org/). They are good but ruby was giving me issue on my windows machine with no reason. And in any case I am better with JavaScript then what I can do with ruby. 

And also [docpad](http://docpad.org/) is having wonderful plugins system and easy to start skeleton. I was able to get up and started in just no time. 

I was hosting my blog with [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) a wonderful .net CMS system. But the thing is it very big for my need. And to edit them I have to write lot more code just to move few parts here and there

[docpad](http://docpad.org/) on other hand make it very easy to move things as at the end it is just a static html files. So, if I like give somewhat different touch to my any specific page I can give them specifically. I don't need to change complete theme for that. Which is there in other kinda blog engines. 


>Yes, and I don't like php. At all. Giving me feeling of old ASP pages. I never worked on that and never want to work on that... 

So, as of now. I happy with my static file generator that is doing much more than needed, with light weight node back end and static file as front end. 

Hopefully my blog get massive hit, as I already have set virtually infinite scalability with my static html pages ;).

Till now experience with [Docpad](http://docpad.org) is wonderful. There are few hiccups here and there but overall it is nice and with lots of plugins to make life even more easier.
